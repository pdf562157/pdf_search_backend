  "3": "ANNEXURE- A\n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS FOR COUNTER UNMANNED AIRCRAFT\nSYSTEM (UAS) / REMOTELY PILOTED AIRCRAFT (RPA) SYSTEM\n\n1. Introduction\n\nUnmanned Aircraft (UA) or Remotely Piloted Aircraft System (RPAS),commonly\nknown as \u201cDrone\u201d is considered to be a game-changer technology in modern life.\nDrones are being extensively used for various applications. However, drones may also\nbe used for destructive purposes such as delivering explosives and harmful cargo for\ncreating havoc ete.\n\nDrones also have the potential for disrupting manned aircraft movements especially in\nthe proximity to airports. There are numerous examples of hours-long hold up of\nairport operations due drone sightings like Gatwick and Dubai airports. Such incidents\nhave led the aviation community and security agencies to consider the deployment of\ncounter-drone systems by airport operators to protect airports and their proximities to\nprotect the airports from rogue drones\n\n2. System Description\n\n\u2018The Counter Drone System should provide Multi Sensor based complete and\ncomprehensive solution with regards to drone detection, tracking, identification and\nneutralization (Soft Kills and Hard kill options). Soft-kill options will not work if the\nunmanned aircraft employs navigation through INS or VPS and is not remotely\npiloted i.e. fully autonomous. Hence the neutralization by hard kill measures such as\nlaser, and Fire Control locking system is inevitable. The decision to employ such hard\nkill measures shall be depending on the situations and specific to the airport as per\nSOP. The hard kill option will be the last resort for drone neutralization. If the hard\nkill option is decided then, the laser will be the first hard kill option for drone\nneutralization\n\nThe solution should integrate detection, identification and engagement sub-systems\nand provide operator with a composite air situational picture as well as tools for\nmanaging response.\n\nThe salient features of Counter Drone system are given below\n\na, The Counter UAV solution should be effective and efficient in all-weather\nconditions with minimum of 95% detection and neutralization probability of all\ndrones with or without RF command and control and data link.\n\nb. The C-UAS solution should simultaneously detect, identify and neutralize\nmultiple / swarm of drones (minimum 20 Nos).\n\nc. Operation of the counter drone solution in no case should interfere with RF\nenvironment of Airport operations.\n\nPage 2 of 10\n",
  "4": "d. C-UAS may be an integrated solution with multiple sub-systems for detection,\nidentification and neutralization (like Radar, RF, EO, Infrared (IR), etc. systems\nfor detection & identification and jammers (Soft Kills) and laser and Fire Control\nLocking system (FCS) by ASG (Hard Kill) for neutralization.\n\ne. C-UAS integrated system should be of an open standard architecture to allow\nseamless integration with other systems of detection, identification and\nneutralization having standard interfaces and protocols.\n\nf. The C-UAS solution should integrate detection, identification and engagement\nsub-systems and provide operator with a composite air situational picture as well\nas tools for managing response.\n\ng. The solution should be scalable and easily deployable.\n\n3. System Capability\n\nThe composition of Counter Drone System\na. Primary Drone Detection Radar:\nb. Radio Frequency (RF) Detector and Direction Finder;\nElectro Optical (EO) and Infra-Red (IR) Sensor;\n. Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) and RF Jammer;\n. Hard-kill options such as Laser and Fire Control locking system (FCS); and\nCommand & Control, Communication, Computers and Intelligence\nmanagement systems.\n\nmhepe\n\nThe system should identify, classify and provide alerts to the user through Audio\nand Visual alarm to the system operator at the Command and Control center on\ndetection of a Drone / RPA / UAS platform.\n\nThe system should have provision of inbuilt database library to identify specific\ntype of drones which shall be updatable on periodic basis.\n\n4. The deployment of Counter Unmanned Aircraft system (C-UAS)\n\nCounter unmanned aircraft system needs to be deployed in the airport to protect the\nairspace from unauthorized unmanned aircraft / rogue drone in and around airfield. In\nthe approach funnel area, the coverage shall be approximately 10 KMs and other\ndirection of airfield it shall be around 05 KMs radius.\n\nThe number of Counter Unmanned Aircraft system (C-UAS) to be deployed in\nparticular airfield is depending on the geographical conditions of that airfield and\navailability of Line of sight coverage and area to be covered. All the counter drone\nsystem deployed in any airfield needs to be integrated in the Command and Control\nCenter (CCC).\n\nPage 3 of 10\n\n",
