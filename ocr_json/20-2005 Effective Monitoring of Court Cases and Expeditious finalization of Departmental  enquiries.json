As regards the court cases, there is\nnoticeable aswell as avoidable delay in submission of brief facts and\nparawise comments to the concerned Central Govt. Advocate for preparation\nof draft counter affidavit Effective liaison is not maintained with the CGSCs in\nearly drafting/. finalisation of DCA theraby creating a situation wherein\nDepartment has to invariably seek more tiie from the Hon'ble Courts in filing\nthe reply/counter affidavit on behalf the respondents. Effective \u2018pairvi\u2019 in the\ncourt cases is not being done by the concerned Liaison Officers. CGSCs are\nnot properly briefed about.the facts of the cases thus resulting in weakening\nthe stand taken by the Department and in some cases judgments of the\ncourts being pronounced against it.\n\ne\ni.)\no\no\nLa)\n0\ne\no\n8\nfa)\noO\nis]\n8\n9\n9\nis)\nas)\noO\noO\noO\ncs)\no\n\u00a9\ne\n\u00b0\n\u00a9\n\u00b0\n\n2. Similarly in the cases of pending 9<s under Rule 36 of CISF Rules\n2001, it has been noticed that there is inordinate delay in finalisation/issue of\ncharge sheet to the delinquent. The Enquiry Authorities do not take adequate\nsteps in completion of the DE proceedings expeditiously resulting in avoidable\nincrease in pendency of DEs. At times the enquiries are delayed on account\nof the Enquiry Officer! Presenting Officer being away on leave and/or the\ncharged official/ PWs being away on leave/ Duty etc. Even after completion of\nthe enquiry proceedings, the Disciplinary Authorities are some time taking\nunreasonably long time in finalisation/issue of final order.\n\nContd.
