  "1": "Appendix-\u2018A\u2019 \nIS 17051: 2018 \nIndian Standard \nTEXTILES- BULLET RESISTANT JACKETS \nPERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS \n1 SCOPE \n1.1 This standard prescribes the minimum performance requirements of bullet resistant jackets for \nprotection against small arms and ammunition and provides procedures for their evaluation. The \nscope of the standard is limited to physical and ballistic evaluation of bullet resistant jackets against \nin service small arms ammunition (see Table 7) used by the Indian armed forces, paramilitary, state \npolice forces and other law enforcement agencies. \n1.2 Physical and ballistic evaluation criteria and measurements are confined to the laboratory and test \nrange conditions only. The data generated are strictly valid for comparison under same conditions \nof test. \n1.3 This standard does not cover the threats from knives, sharply pointed instruments and shards, \nsplinters and fragments from the hand grenades. These aspects may be dealt with in other \nstandards.  \n1.4 This standard covers only the basic design of bullet resistant jackets and provides guidelines with \nrespect to their evaluation. Specific requirements in terms of protection area of the body, accepted \nweight penalty of the jackets, threat perception, operating conditions, etc, are entirely dependent \nupon the user/ purchaser. It is strongly recommended that the user work out the size, weight, \nthreat, design factors, maneuverability, protection panels and other aspects before finalizing \nqualitative requirements. \nNote:- The tests described in the standard have inherent hazards, hence adequate safety norms for \npersonnel and property shall be employed strictly while conducting the tests. \n2. REFERENCES  \nThe standards listed in Annex A contain provisions which through reference in this text, constitute \nprovisions of this standard. At the time of publication, the editions indicated were valid. All standards \nare subjected to revision, and parties to agreements based on this standard are encouraged to \ninvestigate the possibility of applying the most recent editions of the standards indicated in Annex A. \n3. TERMINOLOGY \nFor the purposes of this standard, the following definitions shall apply. \n3.1 Acceptance Quality Limit (AQL) \u2013 Quality level that is worst tolerable process average when a \ncontinuing series of lots is submitted for acceptance sampling. \nNotes:- \n1. This concept only applies when a sampling scheme with rules for switching, and for \ndiscontinuation, such as in IS 2500 (Part 1) or IS/ISO 3951 (Part 1) to (Part 5), is used. \n2. Although individual lots with quality as bad as the acceptance quality limit may be accepted \nwith fairly high probability, the designation of an acceptance quality limit does not suggest \nthat this is a desirable quality level, Sampling schemes found in IS 2500 (Part 1), with their \nrules for switching, and for discontinuation of sampling inspection, are designed to encourage \nsuppliers to have process averages consistently better than the AQL. Otherwise, there is a high \nrisk that the inspection severity will be switched to tightened inspection under which the \ncriteria for lot acceptance become more demanding. Once on tightened inspection, unless \naction is taken to improve the process, it is very likely that the rule requiring discontinuation \nof sampling inspection pending such improvement will be invoked.",

This is also known as behind armour blunt trauma (BABT). \nBFS is the perpendicular distance between two planes, both of which are parallel to the front \nsurface of the backing material fixture. One plane contains the reference point on the original \nbacking material. The other plane contains the point that represents the deepest indentation in \nthe backing material (see Fig. 2). \n \nFig. 2 Measurement of Back Face Signature. \n \n3.6 Backing Material \u2013 A homogeneous block of polymeric / mineral clay placed in contact with \nthe back of the edge armour panel during ballistic testing and is used to measure BFS/depth of \nindentation. \n3.7 Ballistic Limit \u2013 For a given projectile, the velocity at which the bullet is expected to perforate \nthe armour panel 50 percent of the time. It is also denoted as V 50\u00b0. \n3.8 Ballistic Material / Panel \u2013 The protective component of any bullet resistant jacked sample, \nconsisting of ballistic resistant materials.

  "39": "ANNEX E \n(Clause 6.4.1) \nNOTES ON UPPER PREDICTION LIMIT (UPL) \n \nE-1 Measurement of back face signature involves conditioning and calibration of backing material and \nuse of handheld equipment during measurement. Despite the measures taken to minimize variation, \nthese activities introduce inherent variability in the test results. The probability of an acceptable design \nfailing the ballistic trials increases due to these variations.  \nE-2 For this reason, probability of allowing excessive BFS within permissible limits is relevant for lot \ntesting. In case any BFS exceeds the permissible limit, there shall be 95 percent confidence that 90 \npercent of all BFS depths shall be less than or equal to maximum permissible limit. This is explained in \ndetails in E-3 to E-5 (95 percent confidence level and 90 percent probability). \nE-3 It can be assumed that the population of BFS measurements follows normal distribution (see Fig. \n20). Difference between confidence and prediction levels is given in Fig. 21. In Fig.21, the interval range \nextends beyond the tail areas of the actual population distribution (solid line). This is because the \ntolerance interval takes into account the uncertainty of knowing the true location of the mean of the \npopulation distribution. This uncertainty is represented by the confidence level associated with the \ninterval. The confidence level indicates the likelihood that the interval covers the desired proportion \nof the population. \nE-4 The upper prediction limit is a prediction of the upper tail of a normal distribution which provides \na value which the next shot is unlikely to exceed (probability) that is  \nXu \u2013X\u0305 +Ku                            ---(7) \nWhere Xu is the Upper Prediction Limit, X\u0305  is average of BFS, \ud835\udf0e is standard deviation and K is \nthe constant determine by the probability and confidence levels.  \nK = Z\u2082 - p + \u221aZ\u2082\u00b2 - p \u2013ab   \n \n--(8) \n                  a    \n \nWhere, \na = 1 - Z1\u00b2 - \u03b2 \n \n2(N-1) \n \nb= Z\u2081\u00b2-p   -  Z1\u00b2 - \u03b2 \n \n      2(N-1) \n \np= 0.9 that is probability that no BFS exceeds maximum limit shall be at least 90 percent; \n\u03b2= 0.95 that is confidence level of 95 percent; and  \nN= number of BFS readings. \nConsidering one-sided critical values in normal distribution  \nZ\u2081-p   = 1.28            and         Z\u2081-\u03b2   = 1.645 \n \nE-4.1 Value of K for different BFS readings as per the equation 8 are given in Table 15.",

These can \nbe mineral clay where one of the main components is kaolin, or polymeric clay which use petroleum \njolly and long chain aliphatic acids. However, as these are commercial materials, their exact \ncomposition is undisclosed and keep changing with time. The rheological and mechanical properties \nof these materials are influenced by the composition and additives used. Prior usage of the backing \nmaterial also changes its subsequent properties because of thixotropicity. Knowledge of the backing \nmaterial helps in understanding its behavior under thermal and shear loads and also its service period. \n \nK-3 Some of the properties of Roma Plastilina #1 (RP#1) are given in Table 20. Any new backing material \ncan be analysed for these parameters using a rheometer.
