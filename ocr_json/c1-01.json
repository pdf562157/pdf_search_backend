Passengers to ensure that they are sure of the contents of their \nbaggage. \n \n \nc. \nMeasures against terrorist attacks. \n \ni. \nGuarding of aircraft. \nii. \nApron / airport access control. \niii. \nArmed reserve to meet such emergencies. \niv. \nProximity of police stations / out posts. \nv. \nEffective alternate communication system. (Other than normal \ntelephone) \n   \n2. \nThe following aspects having gray areas need urgent attention: - \n \na. \nAccess control \n \ni. \nFrisking of staff entering the operational area directly from other \naccess points. \nii. \nEffective surveillance cover in and around the terminal building \nand operational areas at the airports. \niii. \nEntry of visitors if banned should be strictly enforced. \niv. \nStaff members subjected to checking every time they enter the \nsterile lounge. \nv. \nPolitical leader/functionaries and their hangers on enter the apron \narea without passes. \nvi. \nAccess points opening towards operational areas remain \nunguarded. \nvii. \nUnauthorized entry of vehicles in the operational areas. \nviii. \nPersons wearing PIC\u2019s are not subjected to security checks.  \nNeither is nay check done to examine the PIC. \nix. \nConstruction workers being allowed entry in operational areas \nwithout passes and no supervision are being maintained. \nx. \nOuter gates of the airport are not being manned. \nxi. \nGuarding of terminal building undertaken only during operational \nhours. \nxii. \nSurveillance arrangements are not effective considering the vast \narea to be guarded vis-\u00e0-vis the staff deployed for the purpose.  \n \n        b.     Perimeter Security: \n \n            At many of the airports, perimeter security is rather weak and \nbeset with following shortcomings: - \n \ni. \nNo perimeter guarding arrangements. \nii. \nPerimeter wall / fencing broken.",
  "3": "iii. \nHeight of perimeter wall / overhang below the standard \nspecifications. \niv. \nInadequate lighting arrangements. \n \nv. \nWild growth on either side of the perimeter fencing. \nvi. \nPerimeter road is non-existent. \nvii. \n Watchtowers are not manned. \nviii. \n Location of shrines inside operational areas (e.g. Calcutta, Delhi, \nVaranasi & Amritsar ). \n \n       c.

Surveillance arrangements \n \n       Surveillance arrangements are airports need to be upgraded to ensure \nthat areas      in and around the terminal building and operational areas are \nsuitably covered. \n \n \nSurveillance is also required in terminal buildings.  Patrols through \nlounges should be on the look out for transference of weapons between \npassengers and staff. \n \n \nf. Passenger Profiling \n \nPassenger profiling has not been given the desired degree of \nprominence in India.  However, this aspect is taken very seriously in \ncountries like USA, Israel etc., and suspicious indicators are observed at \nclose quarters to detect terrorist and others traveling on forged \ndocuments etc.  Personnel need to be trained in recognizing specific",
  "4": "indicators.  It may be mentioned that suspicious indicators can consist of \ntravel documents, luggage, personal appearance and behaviours, \naudio-visual manifestation etc.  \n   \n \n \nThe passengers are closely watched while posing questions.  \nDuring their answer, care and caution is observed to detect suspicious \nactivities based on behaviours, speech, body movement, and facial \nexpression etc., displayed by the passengers at the airports. \n \ng. Contingency arrangements \n \ni. \nArmed striking reserve to handle emergent situations not catered \nfor. \nii. \nAerodrome committee meetings are not being held hi-annually. \niii. \nAerodrome committee control rooms have not been set up at many \nairports. \nh.

Staff position \u2013 Airport Security staff \n \n \nThere is deficiency in the actual strength vis-\u00e0-vis sanctioned strength of \nthe security staff.  The problem is further compounded when the posted \nstaff strength is depleted due to deployment on law and order and other \nduties. \n \nk. Inadequate security in the parking areas \n \n \nAt majority of the airports, there are no arrangements to check the \nvehicles entering the car part.  At some airports the problem gets \ncompounded due to lack of co-ordination between the airport Security and \nthe traffic police. \n \n \nIn view of the above, it is a matter of paramount importance that security \narrangements in respects of all the areas envisaged above are augmented \nby the concerned departments/ agency so as to prevent unlawful \ninterference with civil aviation operations.   \n (P.
