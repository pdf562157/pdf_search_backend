The following\naspects of the code of conduct shall be strictly adhered to by the auditors: ~\n\ni) Professional behaviour: Members conduct themselves at all times in a manner which will\nmaintain the good reputation of the profession and its ability to serve the public interest. In\ndoing so, members are expected to avoid any action that would discredit the profession.\nWhile there are business considerations involved in the creation and development of a\nprofessional practice, a member's practice should be based primarily upon a reputation for\nprofessional excellence. A member is expected to act in relation to other members with the\ncourtesy and consideration he or she would expect to be accorded by them.\n\nii) Integrity and Due Care: Members perform professional services with integrity and due\ncare. Members are expected to be straightforward, honest and fair dealing in all\nprofessional relationships. They are also expected to act diligently and in accordance with\napplicable technical and professional standards when providing professional services.\nDiligence includes the responsibility to act, in respect of an engagement, carefully,\nthoroughly, and on a timely basis. Members are required to ensure that those performing\nprofessional services under their authority have adequate training and supervision.\n\niii) Professional Competence: Members maintain their professional skills and competence by\nkeeping informed of, and complying with, developments in their professional standards.\nThe public expects the accounting profession to maintain a high level of competence. This\nunderscores the need for maintaining individual professional skill and competence by\nkeeping abreast of and complying with developments in the professional standards and\n\nPage 24 of 106\n",
  "27": "SECRET\n\nGovernment of India\n(Ministry of Civil Aviation)\n\nBUREAU OF CIVIL AVIATION SECURITY\ned National Civil Aviation Security Quality Control Programme - 2018\n\npertinent legislation in all functions where a member practices, or is relied upon because of\nhis or her calling.\n\niv) Objectivity Members do not allow their professional or business judgment to be\ncompromised by bias, conflict of interest or the undue influence of others. The public\nexpects that members will bring objectivity and sound professional judgment to their\nprofessional services. It thus becomes essential that a member will not subordinate\nprofessional judgment to external influences or the will of others. The public interest in the\nobjectivity of a member engaged to perform an assurance or a specified auditing procedure\ntequires that the member be, and be seen to be, free of influences which would impair the\nmember's objectivity. Accordingly, the rules specifically require a member who engages to\nperform an assurance or specified auditing procedures engagement to be independent. The\nethical standard of independence requires the member to be and remain free of any\ninfluence, interest or relationship, in respect of the client\u2019s affairs, which impairs the\nmember's professional judgment or objectivity or which, in the view of a reasonable\nobserver, would impair the member's professional judgment or objectivity. As well, the\nrules specifically require that a member, before accepting or continuing an engagement,\ndetermine whether there is any restriction, influence, interest or relationship which, in\nrespect of the proposed engagement, would cause a reasonable observer to conclude that\nthere is or will be a conflict of interest. If there were to be such a conflict, the member is\nrequired to decline or discontinue the particular engagement unless there are accepted\nconflict management techniques which, with the informed consent of the affected client or\nclients, permit the member to accept or continue the engagement. With respect to both\nindependence and conflicts of interest, the profession employs the criterion of whether a\nreasonable observer would conclude that a specified situation or circumstance posed an\nunacceptable threat to a member's objectivity and professional judgment. Only then can\npublic confidence in the objectivity and integrity of the member be sustained, and it is upon\nthis public confidence that the reputation and usefulness of the profession rest. The\nreasonable observer should be regarded as a hypothetical individual who has knowledge of\nthe facts which the member knew or ought to have known, and applies judgment\nobjectively with integrity and due care\n\nv) Confidentiality: Persons involved in monitoring activities should be required to maintain\nstrict confidentiality with regard to their observations and findings. Confidentiality of\nsecurity information provided by sources such as passengers, crew and ground personnel to\nsupplement the NQCP shall be strictly adhered to and appropriate action on feedback\nreceived from sources,\n\na) Members have a duty of confidentiality in respect of information acquired as a\nresult of professional, employment and business relationships and they will not\ndisclose to any third party, without proper cause and specific authority, any\ninformation, nor will they exploit such information to their personal advantage or\nthe advantage of a third party.\n\n\u00bb) The principle of confidentiality includes the need to maintain the confidentiality of\ninformation within a member's firm or employing organization.

A security test may be overt or covert.\n\nA security test should only demonstrate whether a security measures or control\nproved effective at a specific place and time.\n\nSecurity test should focus on access control to security restricted areas, protection\nof aircraft, implementation of screening, with the assistance of standardized test\npiece, etc\n\n2.2.1 Preparation\n\ni,\n\nii\n\nUpon identification of the security measures (\u00a2.g. IED detection by X-ray operators)\nto be tested, the entity conducting the test should appoint a team leader who will\nensure that all requirements for the security tests are fulfilled for the entire duration of\nthe testing window. This may include notifying, in advance, the entities being tested\n(ideally a week in advance, but unusual circumstances may require shorter notices).\nWhen appropriate, law enforcement authorities should also be notified and should\nconfirm receipt of such a notification. Any other entities that conduct testing at the\nsame facility should also be notified to prevent tests from interfering with each other.\nTeam leaders may establish contact with local airport staff to coordinate on-the-field\narrangements such as escorting the testing team on airport premises and granting\nthem appropriate credentials (e.g. boarding passes and airport identification permits),\nas necessary.\n\nTeam leaders should select the test objects (i.e, types and number) to be employed\nduring tests from the catalogue of test objects and coordinate their carriage to the test\nlocations.

Items being carried as test objects for metal detection should be tested to\nensure that their mass will activate metal detectors. At this point a decision should be\nmade as to whether a distractor (e.g. bottle of water for X-ray testing and sets of keys\nfor metal detection) is to be deployed.\n\niv. Entities conducting security tests may also elect to appoint team leaders whose\nresponsibilities mainly include ensuring that the team members conducting the tests\nare carrying out their duties in a consistent, efficient, fair and professional manner.\nTeam leaders can also be tasked with recording the results of the tests, thereby\nallowing the test team to focus on conducting the tests, with a view to compiling the\noutcomes and preparing comprehensive reports. Team leaders may not be carrying\nout a test but would be observing its conduct from a distance, including via closed\ncircuit television (CCTV) where possible.\n\nA) Pre-test briefing\n\nPrior to commencing security testing, a pre-test briefing should take place during which\nteam leaders should establish the role of each team member for the duration of the testing\nactivities, assign tasks and allocate test objects to the team members who are carrying the\ntest objects, maintain a record thereof, and address any local requirements and/or\nconstraints.\nDuring pre-test briefings, team leaders should consider addressing the following questions\nwith all team members:\n\na. Why are we testing?\n\nb. Where are we testing?\n\nc. What are we testing?\n\nd. What are we testing with?\n\n\u00a2. What are the previous recommendations at this airport, airline, entity or facility?\n\nand\n\nf. What are the roles and responsibilities of each team member?\nAll team members should be familiar with contingency measures to account for events such\nas:\n\nseparation during travel and testing;\nanonymity being compromised due to recognition of team members or test objects\nby security staff prior to testin;\nunplanned revealing of a test object;\naborting of the covert test due to, inter alia\ni, health and safety concerns;\ndetection of a test object prior to entering a screening checkpoint;\niii. _ significant negative operational implication (e.g. causing flight delay); and\n\noP\n\nae\n\nPage 42 of 106\n",

The risk from\ncarrying out security tests should be evaluated (e.g. impact assessment in case of loss of\ncontrol of the test piece), for example the testing of an automated hold baggage systems,\nif not correctly managed, could lead to a test object boarding an aircraft and causing\nsignificant operational delays.\n\nThe quality and quantity of security test should be sufficient to provide robust data that\ncan provide for trend analysis (i.e. too few tests may not provide Statistically valid\nresults). Entities should therefore consider sharing information to assist their effort to\nassess and improve the effectiveness to their security systems.\n\nEntities responsible for implementing aviation security measures are allowed to conduct\nsecurity tests to assess their capability to comply with applicable security requirements.\nThe extent to which such entities are allowed to conduct test activities has been\nprescribed by the Director General, BCAS. Security tests conducted by entities\nresponsible for implementing aviation security measures may include the following.\n\na) Access control (e.g. using expired or swapped airport identification permits,\ntailgating or bypassing measures);\n\nb) Protection of aircraft, cargo, supplies and hold baggage form authorized access (e.g.\nby impersonating an intruder and/or other unauthorized person);\n\n\u00a9 Aircraft security search (e.g. using test objects concealed in areas and/or other\ncompartments of the cabin that are accessible by passengers);\n\n4) Screening of hold baggage, cargo and mail when performed by or on behalf of\nairports and/or aircraft operators; and\n\n\u00a9 Protection of facilities (e.g. identification of unaccompanied item left in airport\npublic terminals) and airport perimeter (c.g. airside patrols and surveillance)\n\n2.2.3.
