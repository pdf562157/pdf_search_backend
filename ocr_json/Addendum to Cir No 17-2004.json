As mandated by the BCAS, the baggage reconciliation is done by the airlines\neither electrorically or manually without fail. Regional Director, BCAS, Amritsar has also\nrecommended that physical identification ofbaggage by passengers in the open airside be removed\nas security persormel ofthe airlines mandatorily conduct baggage reconciliation either manually\nor tlrough computedzed system. It has also been noted that movement of passengers from the\nSIIA to the open airside and vice-versa is not desirable from the point of view of maintaining\nste lity in the SHA.\n3. \nRegional Director, BCAS, Amritsar has submitted a report that the airlines operating at\nSrinagar Airport have been doing baggage reconciliation through their security personnel either\nmanually or electronically, thereby fulfilling the basic principle that registered baggage of a\npassenger who is not on board the aircraft, is not transported\n4. \nThe matter has been examined in this office and it has been decided to dispense with the\nexisting provision ofphysical baggage identification by passengers at J&K airports. Accordingly,\nPara 5 of the BCAS AVSEC Circular No. 17l2OO4 dared 0410812004 which reads as under:\nD- \\o\\L l, l\\4\n-rxli,t\nPage I of2",
