The\nhead of the concerned organization would be next person to get this information from his\nown field person. He in turn, would bring the incident to the notice ofthe local police station\nas well as to the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (AERB) who is the regulator (as per\nRadiation Protection Rule 2004 under the Atomic Energy Act) for transportation, storages\nand use of radiation source in the public domain. This will be the trigger mechanism for\ninitiating any mitigation processes by the states agencies.\n\nFurther in case of loss/theft of radioactive sources, the recommended response plan for\nrecovery/retrieval and disposal of the radiological source would be as follow:\n\n1) AERB will inform the Crisis Management Group (CMG), DAE through DAE\nEmergency Control Room (DAE-ECR), Contact Details of 24 x 7 operational DAE-\nEmergency Control Rooms are- main DAE-ECR{022-22023978,022-22021714,(Mobile)\n09969201364} & alternate DAE -ECR {022-25991070, 022-25515283, (Mobile)\n099692013651}. In addition, it is envisaged that the concerned public official will follow\ntheir own SOP & intimate the concerned agencies for ensuring appropriate response.\n\n2) Expert response agencies (Police /NDRF/relevant state authorities) after reaching the\nincident spot, if feel that they need an expert advice or technical support from nodal ministry\n(DAE); they should contact CMG, DAE through DAE-Emergency Control room. While\ninforming, they are requested to provide exact location, contract numbers of concemed\nDM/SP/Local police station and details of incident with brief description of the object (if\npossible, along with photograph taken from the distance).\n\n3) Upon receipt of such information, the CMG, DAE will get activated and will get in\ntouch with the local authorities to decide about further course of action.\n",

Local district authorities should provide adequate\nresources for handling and transportation of the contaminated material to the safe disposal\nsite.\n\n9) Incase required, media briefing will be done by the designated state official. He may\nseek Technical inputs from AERB, if he desires.\n\n10) After recovery/retrieval of the source and after completing of activities related with\ndecontamination and safe disposal (as per scenario requirements), with due concurrence of\nAERB, the closure of radiological emergency scenario will be declared by the concerned\nDM/SP.\n\n9.2 DON\n\nFor response to radiological Emergency: -\n\n1) Don\u2019t send untrained responders/volunteers.\n2) Don\u2019t send trained responders without proper PPEs and detection equipment.\n3) Don\u2019t send responders without taking proper guidance.\n\nThe other relevant clause of the latest CMP document related with radiological equipment\nand related with the caution for danger of radiation and its handling is to be synchronized\nwith this SOP during the radiological emergencies.\n\n10.
