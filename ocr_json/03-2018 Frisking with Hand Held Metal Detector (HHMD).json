AS- 03 /2018\nSub: \"Friskino with Hand Held Metal Detector (HHMD'I : Reo\"\nIt has come to the notice of APS HQ that in some of the airports the frisking\nofficers (Male/Female) during the course of frisking at pre-embarkation security check\npoints in SHA are running the HHMD over the body of the passengers which is\ngenerating complaints, especially from female passengers.\n2. \nIn this regard, it should be made clear to the friskers that as per specification of\nHHMD issued by BCAS vide AVSEC Circular 2512004 dated 27.12.2004 the HHI4D is able\nto detect metal without being in direct contact with the object. However, method of\nscreening as explained in the BCAS AVSEC Circular No. 2312005 dated 11.07.2005 must\nbe followed during frisking of passengers at pre-embarkation security checks. The\nTraining Reference Book (TRB) issued by BCAS for Screeners certification clearly states\nthat HHMD should be kept at a distance of approximately 01 inch (2.5 cms) from the\nbody of a passenger. The copy of the Training Reference Book of BCAS is enclosed\nherewith for ready reference.\n3. \nTherefore, all CASOS are directed to conduct special on the job training for\nscreeners deployed for PESC at SHA for sensitizing them on the above aspect and also\nbrief frisking officers (male/female) to be careful while using HHMD during frisking to\navoid direct body contact of passenger with HHMD.\n4. \nAll DisG are requested to ensure meticulous implementation of the above\ndirection by the ASGS under their respective jurisdlction.\nEncl : As above\n,l)\nIt r K^:'r':\n(u. a. eanapatny,-ri$i\nDistribution: \nAddl Dc/Airport sector\nDIsG/Airport (Delhi, lvlumbai, Kolkata & Chennai):\nDIG/CASO IGI Delhi, CSIA Mumbai and Chennai\nAll CASO ASGS, CISF",
