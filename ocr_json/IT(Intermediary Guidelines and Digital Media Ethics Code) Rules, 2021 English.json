Therefore, the \ncontext in which an issue is presented within a film or video may be given consideration. Factors \nsuch as the setting of a work (historical, fantasy, realistic, contemporary etc.), the manner of \npresentation of the content, the apparent intention of the content, the original production date of the \ncontent, and any special merits of the work may influence the classification decision. \n(b) Theme: \nClassification decisions may take into the theme of any content but will depend significantly on the \ntreatment of that theme, especially the sensitivity of its presentation. The most challenging themes \n(for example, drug misuse, violence, pedophilia, sex, racial or communal hatred or violence etc.) are \nunlikely to be appropriate at the junior levels of classification. \n(c) Tone and impact: \nCurated content may be judged in its entirety from the point of view of its overall impact. The tone \nof content can be an important factor in deciding the influence it may have on various groups of \npeople. Thus, films/serials that have a stronger depiction of violence may receive a higher \nclassification.  \n(d) Target audience: \nThe classification of any content may also depend upon the target audience of the work and the \nimpact of the work on such audience.",
  "16": "34  \nTHE GAZETTE OF INDIA : EXTRAORDINARY \n   [PART II\u2014SEC. 3(i)] \nPART II \nISSUE RELATED GUIDELINES \nThis part of the guidelines comprises the issues and concerns that apply in varying degrees to all categories \nof classification and elaborates the general approach that may be taken in this regard to the same. These \nconcerns are listed in alphabetical order, and are to be read with the four General Guidelines listed in Part I  \n(a) Discrimination: \nThe categorical classification of content shall take into account the impact of a film on matters such \nas caste, race, gender, religion, disability or sexuality that may arise in a wide range of works, and \nthe classification decision will take account of the strength or impact of their inclusion. \n(b) Psychotropic substances, liquor, smoking and tobacco: \nFilms or serials, etc. that as a whole portray misuse of psychotropic substances, liquor, smoking and \ntobacco would qualify for a higher category of classification. \n(c) Imitable behaviour: \n(1) \nClassification decisions may take into account any portrayal of criminal and violent behaviour \nwith weapons. \n(2) \nPortrayal of potentially dangerous behaviour that are likely to incite the commission of any \noffence (including suicide, and infliction of self-harm) and that children and young people \nmay potentially copy, shall receive a higher classification. \n(3) \nFilms or serials with song and dance scenes comprising lyrics and gestures that have sexual \ninnuendos would receive a higher classification. \n(d) Language: \n(1) Language is of particular importance, given the vast linguistic diversity of our country. The use \nof language, dialect, idioms and euphemisms vary from region to region and are culture-\nspecific. This factor has to be taken into account during the process of classification of a work \nin a particular category. \n(2) Language that people may find offensive includes the use of expletives. The extent of offence \nmay vary according to age, gender, race, background, beliefs and expectations of the target \naudience from the work as well as the context, region and language in which the word, \nexpression or gesture is used. \n(3) It is not possible to set out a comprehensive list of words, expressions or gestures that are \nacceptable at each category in every Indian language. The advice at different classification \nlevels, therefore, provides general guidance to consider while judging the level of classification \nfor content, based on this guideline. \n(e) Nudity: \n(1) No content that is prohibited by law at the time being in force can be published or transmitted. \n(2) Nudity with a sexual context will receive a higher classification of \u2015A\u2016. \n(f) Sex: \nNo content that is prohibited by law at the time being in force can be published or transmitted. The \nclassification of content in various ratings from U/A 16+ to \u2015A\u2016 shall depend upon the portrayal of \nnon-explicit (implicit) to explicit depiction of sexual behaviour. \n(g) Violence: \nClassification decisions shall take account of the degree and nature of violence in a work. \n[F.
