In doing so, care \n \nshould be exercised that the information of threat is communicated only to a few \n \nselect staff whose follow up actions do not cause panic amongst other staff and \n \npassengers. \n \n \n(b) \nIt is vital to have search plans prepared in advance and staff trained in \n \nthem. The objective is to make sure that the whole terminal building is checked \n \nas quickly and effectively as possible. \n \n \n(c) \n Search plans must be readily available at all times. Architects\u2019 drawings, \n \nchecked for accuracy and appropriately adapted, are suitable for this purpose. \n \nSufficient spare copies should be available for use during search operations. \n \nSearchers and the coordinator can then eliminate sections from the plan as they \n \nare declared clear. \n \n9.10.2  Search sectors \n \n \n(a) \nThe first step in preparing a search plan is to divide the terminal building \n \ninto sectors. The building may already be segregated into various zones and \n \ntherefore it may be convenient to make these the sectors. Each sector must be of \n \nmanageable size for the number of searchers nominated to it.

The numbers required will depend upon \n \nthe size of the search task. Reserves should be appointed in case of absence. \n \nStaff should be trained and rehearsed. \n \n9.10.4  Search priorities \n \n \n(a) \nThose areas that will be used as evacuation assembly areas, together \n \nwith those areas where the greatest number of the public or staff are likely to be \n \nvulnerable, should be searched first. Consider also, as a priority, those public \n \nareas to which the perpetrator may have had easy access such as restrooms, \n \nelevators, stairways and hallways. \n \n \n(b) \nThose areas to which access is normally controlled may be searched last. \n \nDo not overlook car parks, the outside area of the terminal building and the \n \nperimeter. \n \n9.10.5  How to search \n \n \n(a) \n The conduct of searches will depend on local circumstances and local \n \nknowledge.

It should be adapted to reflect the peculiarities of the actual area \n \nbeing searched. \n \n \n(c) \n A search should begin at the entrance to the room. Each searcher or \n \nteam should first stand still and look around the room.

To  achieve \nthis, each airport should designate an isolated parking position to which such aircraft \nmay be moved. The site selected should be, if possible, a minimum of 400 m from any \nother aircraft parking position, taxiway, runway, building, public area, fuel tank farm or \nstorage area for explosive or incendiary material. The isolated parking position may also \nbe used to handle unlawfully seized aircraft which require servicing or special attention; \ntherefore, consideration should be given to its location so it cannot be easily observed \nfrom public areas off airport property. \n \n13.3  Care should be taken to ensure that there are no services such as gas pipelines, \nrefueling hydrant pipes, other fuel lines or electric power cables beneath the aircraft \nparking area surface. If possible, a second isolated parking spot may be designated in \ncase the primary isolated parking position is unavailable or in case of multiple crises. \n13.4  Airport emergency procedures should designate one or more points to which \naffected aircraft might be directed.

The following should be taken into account in selecting \ndesignated points :- \n \n(a) \nThe availability of covered approaches to facilitate action by the security \n \nforces; for example, adjacent buildings, natural features such as undulations in \n \nthe terrain and the presence of trees. \n \n(b)  \nThe need for ASG to have quick and easy access to the scene to deal                     \n \nwith the situation. \n \n(c)  \nThe possible danger to other aircraft or people in the vicinity, and hazards \n \nsuch as fuel tanks. \n \n(d)  \nThe need for isolation from the press and public. \n \n(e)  \nThe continuance, as far as possible, of normal air traffic in and out of the \n \nairport during the incident. \n \nGovernment of India \nBUREAU  OF CIVIL AVIATION SECURITY \n \nBomb Threat Contingency Plan \n \nChapter IX \n \nMISCELLANEOUS",
