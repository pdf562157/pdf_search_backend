A\ndirty bomb is 2 radioactive dispersal device (RDD). The radioactive\nmaterial is dispersed in conjunction with conventional explosives.\n\n3.2 The explosion of 2 bomb in a thickly populated area, may\nlead to a number of causalities on account of the explosive\nmaterial itself, The people in the surrounding area will also get e\ndose of radiation both external and internal. As @ consequence of\nthis, a limited are2 may also get contaminated.\n\n3.3. Unlike a nuclear bomb, a dirty bomb is not a weapon of\nmass destruction. However, it may lead to disruption of normal\ncivic life because the mere possibility of imminent exposure to\nradiation causes a sense of panic among people. One of the major\nobjectives of terrorist groups using a dirty bomb will be to create\nadverse psychological impact, which goes far beyond the actual\nphysical effect.\n\n3.4 in case of a dirty bomb attack, the intention will always be to\ncreate fear, scare, panic and confusion. Therefore, terrorist groups\nare likely to target densely populated cities and sensitive places.\nThese could be railway stations, metros, bus terminals, economic\nRerve centres, entertainment and religious venues, schools,\nshopping complexes, sports stadia, business centers, large\ncongregations ete. in metropolitan cities or State capitals or other\nsensitive towns,\n\n3.5 While it is difficult to predict the cities likely to be targeted,\nit will make sense to focus only on locations/towns/cities, which meet\nthe above criteria becsuse covering the entire country would not be\nfeasible and would also be prohibitive in cost. The dirty bomb can\nalso be used to contaminate crops, food reserves and livestock. This\nwould ensure that the area is rendered unfit for agriculture and\nfarming for years to come.\n\n3.6 The terrorists are likely to use radioactive materials which are\ncomparatively easy to obtain through covert means. The radionuclides\nwhich cuuld be used are isotopes of Cesium, Code!s, Iridium,\nlodine, Strontium, Uranium, Plutonium ete.\n\n192\n",

The terrorists are likely to use containers, which can be\ncarried and handled easily.\n\n3.8 Another possible modus operandiby the terrorists may be to\nplant radioactive material (s) at a place (s) where people congregate\nas this would expose people to radiation. The possibilities of this\nmodus operandi being adopted would be low, as the terrorists are\nlikely to focus their attention on activities which would have e visible\nand demonstrable impact.
