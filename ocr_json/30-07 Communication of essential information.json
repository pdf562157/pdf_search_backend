This is self-explanatory\nas such exercises, sometimes, create panic due to misreporting by\nthe print and the visual media which is avoidable if information is\navailable with the higher authorities. As soon as possible, the local\nPress and the media should also be informed so that the suspense is\nnot built up over a period of time.\n\n(i) Unidentified objects\nSimilarly, any information about sighting and resultant\n\ncordoning activity of an un-identified object at the airports should be\nconveyed by the fastest means.\n\n",
