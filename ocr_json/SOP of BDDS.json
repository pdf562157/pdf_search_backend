To maintain credibility of security\nagencies in their capability and ensure a systematic response to a bomb, suspect or otherwise, it\nis required that an SOP be formed, to tackle such situations without waste of time, so that loss of\nhuman life and property can be minimized. Dedicated Teams of trained personnel for handling\nBOMB threat call are required to prevent any such incident at the airport. As per 2015 survey'\nCISF unit lGl airport has been sanctioned a total strength of 36 personnel for the BDDS wing\nThe rank-wise break-up is as below-\nlnsp/Exe\nSl/Exe\nASI/Exe\nHCiGD\nCT/GD \n.05\nTotal \n-36\n2.
