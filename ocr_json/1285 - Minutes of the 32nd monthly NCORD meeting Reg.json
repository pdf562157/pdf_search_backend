Director General,\nNCB, was held on 12.12.2024 in hybnd mode at NCB HQrs, New Delhi. The agenda covered\nvarious issues related to drug trafficking and abuse in the northem states of Delhi, Uttar\nPradesh, Haryana, and Uttarakhand. The list oipanicipants is attached as Annexure- \"A.\"\n2 \nShri Vikash Kumar. Assistant Director (Coord.), NCB opened thc 32nd Monthly\nNCORD meeting, welcoming Shri Anurag Garg, Director General, NCB, participants ftom\nDelhi. Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, and Uttarakhand, and representatives from other central\nagencies.\n3 \nIn his opening address, DG, NCB emphasized the importance ofstate- and district-level\nNCORD meetings as part of the NCORD mechanism, which is aimed at addressing specific\ndrug trafficking issues. He expressed the need for these meetings to be productive and\npurposeful, rather than routine. He stated that States falling under the Nonhem Region oflndia\nare ofparticular concem when it comes to matters of drug control, because most ofthem have\nlarge urban agglomerations with massive population base and substantial purchasing power\nalong with disposable incomes. AIso, the region is located at the intersection of major\nprocessing hub ofHashish and the manufacturing centre ofpharmar' CBCS which increases the\nchances ofdrug trafficking exponentially. Further, the proximity ofthe area to the intemational\nborder necessitates a close and watchful eye to be maintained. It is important to note that\nvarious States have achieved notable successes in drug supply reduction operations in the\nregion in the recent past. However, much more needs to be done in the coming days to gain a\nflrrmer grip on the situation.\n3.1 As per the stFtey- Magninde of Substance Use in India released by the Ministry of\nSocial Justice & Empowerment in 2019, substantial numben of drug users and dependents\nhave been found in India and this number is likely to increase funher and ifeffective measures\nare not taken to curb this menace in time, it could have serious implications for the nation.\nThere is an urgent need to increase awareness in schools and colleges against the ill effects of\ndrugs. It is essential to maintain sun'eillance around educational institutions to identiff drug\npeddlers and traffickers, enabling DLEAs to understand how drugs are inflrltrating these areas.\nSnrdents must be educated about the harmful effects of drugs and that having drugs does not\nmake one \"cool\". Engaging local heroes fiom sports and other fields in awareness campaigns\ncan enhance the message and encourage positive behaviour among young people.\n3.2 Zero tolerance approach against drug trafficking: DG. NCB urged participants to\nfocus on dismantling entire drug syndicatcs with a 'Bottom-to-Top' & 'Top-to-Bottom'\napproach when investigating NDPS cases. It was emphasized that DLEAs should prioritize the\ncomplete dismantling of criminal networks rather than just targeting those from whose",
  "5": "possession the drug has been recovered. lnvestigation into the financial flow of drug money\nand freezing of assets must be resorted to in apPfopriate cases to disrupt the entire ecosystem\nofdrug networks. Additionally, the importance oftaking strict action against compromised law\nenforcement personnel was also emphasized, as their actions can undermine the entire system.\n0nanaverageonlyRs50to60lakhsworthattachmentshavebeenbydifferentDLEAsduring\nfinancial investigation ofNDPS cases which is a good beginning but much more is possible. It\nwas stated that at many places drugs were freely available in schools, colleges, and universities.\nExample of Tambaram Police, chennai, was cited where police identified peddlers around\ncolleges, obtained information about students buying drugs from them and counselled the\nparents without taking punitive action against the students'\n3.3 Use of database for intelligence' investigation, and Prosecution: DG, NCB urged\nparticipants to fully utilize various databases including NCORD Portal' NIDAAN' NATGRID'\n\"-Counr, and e-Prosecution for intelligence gatherinS, investigations, and monitoring\nprosecution.NlDAANcaneffectivelybeusedtoidentifyhabituatdrugoffenderssothataction\nunderPITNDPScanbeexplored.Heemphasizedthatdrugusersshouldbeviewedmoreas\nvictims of abuse rather than as accused. DLEAs should focus on gathering information from\ndrug users about peddlers, and foster an environment that encourages cooperation rather than\nsuspicion. This approach aims to build a more compassionate and effective response to dmg-\nrelated issues.\nl.4CapacitybuildingofthestateDLf'As:DG,NCBhighlightedtheurgentneedfor\ncap\"cltybultalr,gamongdruglawenforcementagenciestostrengthentheilabilitytocombat\na-g trutfi.ting, especially about manufacturing of synthetic drugs in clandestine labs and\ndivJrsion ofprecursors. NCB is leading such initiatives in collaboration with the LTNODC and\nUS-DEA to conduct training sessions on drug-related topics for State and Central agency\npersonnel. Additionally, five specialized training modules developed by NCB have been shared\nwith the States for integration with their DLEA training curricula, providing valuable insights\non emerging threats for drug law enforcement Officers\n3 '5 \nModernization of State FSLs: The notificatiorr under 52A of the NDPS Act issued by\nDoR in 2022 mandates that the qualitative result of the FSL of a particular sample should be\nreceivedwithinl5days.Afteranotherl5days.thequantitativeanalysisofthepurityofthe\ncontrabandshouldalsobereceived.CapacityofStateFsLinthisregardneedstobelooked\ninto and augmented ifrequired lt was informed that the Hon'ble Supreme Court has granted\nbail in cases of commercial quantity where the charge sheet had been filed without enclosing\nthe test results ofthe contraband\n3.6ExclusiveNDPSCourts:DG'NCBurgedreplesentativesoftheStatesandUTsto\nimpressupontheirlespectiveGovernmentstoestablishcxclusiveNDPSCourtsfolaregionto\naddress the backlog of NDPS case, as in cases where long delays in framing of charges are\nU",

He informed that NCB has collaborated with\nISRO, ADPJN and BISAG to create a comprehensive map of illicit narcotic crop cultivation.\nwhich are being shared with affected States for targeted destruction efforts. Also, since the\nCannabis crop is likely to be harvested in the next few months, atlention to the destruction of\nillicit cultivation is required.\n3.8 Effective Use of the PITNDPS Act: DG, NCB acknowledged the effective\nimplementation ofthe PITNDPS Act by States and UTs and called for a more focused effort\nin taking action against repeat offenders and drug kingpins.\n4 \nUpon conclusion ofthe Opening Address, Shri Neeraj KumarGupta, DDG (NR), NCB\ndelivered a detailed presentation on the agenda points of the meeting. The following points\nwere highlighted in the presentation: -\n4.1 As per the Comprehensive Nalional Survey on the extent and pattem ofsubslance use\nin the country conducted by MoSJ&E in 2019, an alarming picture of the substance use\nscenario has emerged conceming the Northem Region where many States feature among the\ntop l0 States ofthe country affected by drug abuse and also across almost all categories of drug\nuse. The seizures ofCocaine in the last 4 to 5 years were approximalely 300 kgs on an average\nin India, horvever, for the very first time, in Delhi alone reported seizure of about 1300 kgs\nCocaine which is an alarming.\n4.2 Hon'ble UHM directed that DLEAs needed to focus more on seizure olsynthetic drugs\nlike Heroin, Cocaine and Precursor chemicals. These psychotropic substances and synthetic\ndrugs are more harmful than narcotic drugs like Ganja, Hashish and Charas. Countries like the\nUSA were losing approximately 300 people per day because of overdosc of Fentanyl. DDG\n(NR). NCB requested all the agencies to focus more on the seizure of synthetic drugs and\nprecursor chemicals.\n4.3 DG, NCB informed that NCB had forwarded details of licenses granted for usage,\nstorage, consumption and transportation ofprecursor chemicals to the respective DGsP so that\nthe States could keep a watch on possible diversion ofthese chemicals.\n4.4 Prescription drugs tike Tramadol, Alprazolam etc. are being diverted and funher\nmisused and sold over the counter withoul proper prescriptions. Large scale diversion was\ntaking place from companies to suppliers. Apart from these, CBCS is also a matter ofconcem.\nThese drugs were usually available tkough online pharmacies. It has also been noticed that\nDelhi has become a fansit point and consumer as far as pharmaceutical drugs, as well as one\nofthe biggest hubs for diversion ofCBCS to Bangladesh and the North Eastem States.\n4.5 ACP, Delhi Police informed that recently Delhi Police had caught a huge amount of(7\nlakls tablets) Benzodiazepam in one operation. He stated that this issue was raised in a meeting\nChaired b_v Hon'ble LC wherein it was mentioned that chemists or suppliers were also",
  "7": "supplying such tablets to unscripted people. Hence, in Delhi, it was decided to have\ncomputerisation ofall details ofsuch storage ofdrugs.\n4.6 DG, NCB informed that J&K had recently issued guidelines whereby it was mandatory\nfor all chemists to install CCTV cameras. The same would also be shared in 'SAHAYOG\nWhatsApp group' for information to all other States. A computerised record ofall the Schedule\n'H' drugs was also being implemented. States can also take benefit from this.\n(Action by: all States)\nUTTAR PRADESH\n5 \nRepresentative from Uttar Pradesh (ANTF Head) informed rhar they had seized huge\nquantity ofdrug tablets i.e. 2.5 lakhs. He requested for a list ofplaces from where licenses are\ngiven and the quantity thereoffor precursor chemicals.\n5.1 DG, NCB statcd that the list of such licenses has already been shared with DGP of\nStates. However. the same will also be shared with State ANTF units.\n(Action by: NCB)\nUTI\"{R..\\KHA\\D\n6 \nRepresentative from Uttarakhand (ANTF Head) informed that diversion of\npharmaceutical was a major concem in Uttarakhand. In remote areas these companies were\nselling phama drugs.\n6.1 DDC, NR, NCB informed that Uftarakhand had a lot of pharmaceutical companies.\nWhenever NCB investigated cases in the State it had been found that most of the pharma\ncompanies in the State were diverting and selling drugs illegally.\n6.2 \nDDG, NR, NCB stated that drugs were being sent via courier and parcels and that there\nwere a large number ofcourier companies that were collecting the parcels and had no capacity\nto scan the parcels and for which even KYCs were not being collected. The parcels were being\nsent all over India and sometimes even abroad. He stated that the use ofthe Porter app had been\nnotic\u20acd in such cases where tkough the app such delivery of items from anl.rvhere in the\ncountry were being done to the destination addresses. In metro cities, this phenomenon was\neven more critical.\nDEI,HI\n7 \nIt was stated that parcels with drugs *ere increasingly being captured from courier and\nparcel agencies. Request was made to NCB to issue guidelines for keeping a strict vigil on such\ncourier agencies.\n7 .l \nDG, NCB suggested that courier aBencies should be made to appoint/ designate a Nodal\nOfficer at each oftheir outlets who would coordinate with LEAs whenever such instances are\nnoticed. Also, a system needed to be put in place to scan all outgoing and incoming parcels.",
  "8": "7.2 DDG, NR, NCB informed that NCB is conducting various training progralnmes on\nsensitization of the courier and parcel companies. He stated that the Delhi Police could also\nbecome a force multiplier by participating in such training programmes.\n7.3 DDG (NR), NCB informcd the Chair that encrypted apps and cryptocunency were fast\ntuming into the biggest challenges for DLEAs. Usage of cryptocunency for the transaction of\nmoney had been witnessed in the recent past in an NCB Hyderabad case and the susPects in\nthe case were using open source and Google Apps which were difficult to ftace. This was\nespecially so in the meho cities.\n7.4 IC, ANTF, UP informed that the use of Darknet and cr,?locurrency was a major\nconcem but that the States did not have adequate capacity building to effectively tackle these\nnew and emerging technologies. He stated that the State was conducting Workshops for\nlnspectors, Sub-lnspectors and Constables on how to trace drug cases through the use ofthese\nnew emerging technologies.\n7.5 ACP, Delhi stated that they rll'ere holding various Workhops and training programs to\ntackle the challenges posed by new technologies.
