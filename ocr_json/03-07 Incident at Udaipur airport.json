Armed ASG personnel should effectively isolate the\nplace where work is going on from the aircraft. If the work\nplace is too near the aircraft then, work should stop and the\njabour moved away to a safe distance. Also no mobile e.g.\ntractor, truck, fork lift truck or bulldozer etc. should be allowed\nto move in an area near the apron from where it can make a\n\u2018dash\u2019 towards the aircraft.
