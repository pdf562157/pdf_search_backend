  "4": "_:\nREGISTERED BAGGAGE BY PAX TO ASGs\nl.INTRODUCTION:\ni. The responsibility of screening and securing of check-in baggage primarily is\nvested with the concerned Airline/Airport operator where -ln--line baggage\nsystem is in operation. CISF has no direct role in the security of hold baggagi,\nhowever due to visible presence at airports, the passengers often co*pLai., to\ncISF regarding theft from their registered baggage. CISF/ASG should also be\nequally concerned with theft/pilferage/unauthorized tampering of such bags\nas such incidents may adversely impact the overall aviation security scenari6s\nincluding the ambience of securit5r and order at airports.\nii. A number of cases of theft from registered baggage of passengers are being\nreported and it has also come to tight that often no proper complaint has been\nregistered by the concerned airlines as well as no FIR is being lodged by the\nlocai police. sometime multiple stakeholders/organised gangs are found 1o be\ninvolved in such cases.\niii. within an airport, certain areas are vulnerable to theft/pilferage due to their\nbusy and chaotic environment and miscreants tend to target such places. At the\nsame time, there is tendency among the victims not to lodge a complaint, due\nto which the culprits often go scot-free, even after being traced.\niv. Despite electronic and manual surveillance being in place at most airports and\navailable lega1 remedy for such incidents, they continue unabated particularly at\nMetro airports. Therefore, to prevent theft/pilferage and to bring the culprits to\nbook, a more proactive procedure needs to be established.\n2. AIM\nThe aim of this SOP is to devise a procedure regarding complaint reported by\npassengers to CISF/ASG for providing necessary assistance regarding theft in\ntheir hold/check-in baggage, in coordination with the concerned airline/airport\noperator, to preclude the possibility of theft in hold/check-in baggage and to\nmaintain the passenger's belief on CISF. Also, being the principal securit5r agency\nat airports, it should be the endeavor of CISF to keep the airport premises crime-\nfree.\n3. EXISTING\nNS AS PER\nAND BCAS AVSEC ORDERS\nBCAS AvSec Order 05-2022 and NCASP enumerates the provisions of following\nimportant preventive measures for theft and pilferage from hold/ check-in\nbaggage:\nAirport/Aircraft operators shall ensure appropriate measures and methodologr\nare established to prevent theft and pilferage right from acceptance of hold\nbaggage, till it is handed over to passenger at arriving airport. Processes of theft\nprevention plan with relevant resources and equipment shall be incorporated in\nconcerned atrport f aircraft operator SOP.\n(i)\nAppendix-'A'\nSUB.: ACTION TO BE TAKEN ON REPORTING OF THEFT FROM",

Screened hold baggage\nshall be kept under surveillance at all times. The securit5r staff of aircraft\noperator shall escort the securit5r cleared hold baggage from the baggage make-\nup area to the aircraft.\n(v) The Aircraft Operator/ GHA shall ensure that hold baggage is\ntransported/dispatched till aircraft in locked container/ trolley/ vehicle security\nwith securit5r seals.\n(vi) The aircraft operator should create awareness to \nsensitLe\nporters/loader/ground service staff regarding hold baggage handling process.\n(vii) Security stickers/seals- Prescribed security stickers shall be applied to the\nscreened hold baggage by the security staff. In case there are pockets in the hold\nbaggage, security seal may be applied to all the pockets wherever applicable.\nAdditional securit5r measures may be adopted for protection of hold baggage after\napplying securit5r seal. In the event of pocket being found unsealed at the check-\nin counter or in the baggage make-up area, securit5r seal shall be applied only\nafter pocket has been searched or baggage is re-screened.\n(viii) Baggage sorting area is designated as a special security zone and only authorized\npersons shall be allowed to enter it.\n(ix) Airport operator shall ensure the entire BSA area is always under electronic\nsurveillance.\n(x) The Aircraft Operator security staff shall ensure securit5r surveillance and\nsecurity control of baggage in BSA.\n(xi) ASG shall be deployed in B,ggage make-up area. He/she shall be positioned in\nsuch a way to ensure a clear view of all the bags coming on the conveyor belt.\n(xii) Apron patrols either mobile or foot should pay particular attention to baggage\ntrolleys/containers moving between baggage make-up area and the aircraft hold.\nThis is to minimize the risk of any unauthorized article being introduced in the\nhold.\n4. SCOPE\nThe measures for prevention of theft and pilferage in hold baggage have already\nbeen mentioned in BCAS AVSEC Order O5l2O22 that should be followed by all\nconcerned stakeholders especially the airline and airport operators.\nThis SOP outlines the specific steps that must be taken in incidents of theft that\nPAX report to CISF/ASG. Since the CISF does not screen, transfer or handle\nregistered/check-in baggage, the roie can be allocated in the following three\nsteps for more clarit5r within the scope of this SOP:\nI. \nCo-ordination.\nU.

The same may be covered in regular APSC meetings and Airport\nAdvisory Committee on Security (AACS) discussions. Non-compliance shall\nbe taken up at such forums as well as reported to concerned airline, airport\noperator and BCAS.\nMechanism for dealing with reported theft cases: The passenger may\nnotifii ASG of theft or loss in hold baggage verbally or in writing (including via\nemail or other possible means). To handle such instances, the following\nshould be standard practice:\n(af Initial reporting by pa* Based on the complaint of pax (verbal or written),\nan enquiry shall be conducted covering all facts and details related to the\ntheft/missing baggage.

This may be included in the agenda in APSC meetings for\nimplementation at airports.\nF Random frisking of personnel, particularly those dealing with registered\nbaggage/GHA staff, should be carried out and a pat down check, including\nthe removal of shoes may be carried out to detect such pilferage incidents\nand to serve as a strong deterrent.

The bottom line is that they should be\nable to prevenf such incidents by close monitoring and detect them as and\nwhen they are reported.\nThe ASGs, when made aware of such complaints of theft/pilferage and\nother illegal activities must take concrete proactive steps in dealing with\nsuch complaints/incidents to uphold the faith of the public.\nPassengers complaining about theft of their belongings should rrot be\ndiscouraged.
