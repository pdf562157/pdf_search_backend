In order to facilitate issuance of Passport to Government employees, et al;\nwho find difficulties to obtain Identity Certificate (IC) /No Objection Certificate (NOC)\nfrom their department, it has been decided to introduce a new feature which is\ntermed as \u2018Prior Intimation\u2019 letter to the controlling authority by the Passport\napplicant before submission of a Passport application.\n\n2. Basically, Prior Intimation is a letter from the Passport applicant giving\nintimation to his/her Controlling /Administrative Authority (employer)\nregarding submission of Passport application. This can be submitted by the\napplicant in the format of \u2018Annexure-N\u2019. After submission of Passport application\nby such an employee, the copy of this Prior Intimation would be sent to the same\nControlling/Administrative Authority under which the employee is working. In case\nthe employer has any objection regarding issuance of Passport to that employee, they\nmay revert back to concerned Regional Passport Office mentioning the details of such\nobjection. However, the final decision will be taken by the concerned Passport\nIssuing Authority. If Prior Intimation is submitted by the applicant, Passport\nwould be issued on the basis of Pre-Police Verification, however the provisions\nof Police Verification in reissue cases will remain applicable.\n\n3. Henceforth, anyone of the following documents can be submitted by\nGovernment Servants, PSU/Autonomous body employees, et al. for submission of\napplication for Passports:\n\n(a) Copy of Prior Intimation to Controlling / Administrative Authority; or\n(b) No Objection Certificate from Controlling / Administrative Authority; or\n(c) Identity Certificate from Controlling / Administrative authority.\n\n4. No Objection Certificate (NOC) is issued in the format of \u2018Annexure-M\u2019 by\nthe Controlling /Administrative Authority of the employee working under them for\nobtaining Passport by any Government Servants, PSU / Autonomous body\nemployees, et al. If NOC is submitted Passport will be issued on Post-Police\nVerification basis.\n\n5. Identity Certificate (IC) is issued in the format of \u2018Annexure-B' by the\nControlling /Administrative Authority of the employee working under them for\nobtaining Passport by any Government Servants, PSU / Autonomous body\nemployees, et al. If IC is submitted Passport will be issued on No-Police\nVerification basis. The spouse of such employees, and dependent children up to\n",
  "5": "the age of 18 years, has an option to submit IC for expeditious issue of passport. In\ncase of IC, the applicant is also required to submit 'Annexure-I'.\n\n6. It may be noted that the following provisions will remain applicable as\nmentioned below:\n\na, While IC should be issued preferably on Official Stationery (letterhead); NOC on\nplain paper with signature/stamp can be accepted, on the assumption that\nsuch offices are using plain paper for day to day correspondence. Prior\nIntimation (PI) is required to be submitted on plain paper by the Passport\napplicant.\n\nb. Telephone, fax and e-mail id of the Controlling / Administrative Office (to the\nextent available) should be indicated in all the three documents for the purpose\nof confirmation.\n\nc. Military personnel with c/o APO address (e.g. 56 APO/99 APO) may submit\napplications at their station of posting or at their permanent address, and write\ntheir permanent address in passport [against present address otherwise].\nSpouse of such personnel [and adult children, when spouse has\nexpired /divorced] may receive the passport, with authority letter, either by hand\nor by post. This would apply to similarly placed Air Force/Navy personnel as\nwell.\n\nd. If Goverhment/PSU employees, et al. are transferred after submission of the\npassport application or passport is returned undelivered due to such transfer,\nthe same be re-dispatched, on request (along with copy of transfer order), at the\nnew address, after correction/endorsement of address. However, if police\nverification was required and was not completed, it will be done at the new\nplace.\n\ne. The validity of the documents mentioned at para-3 will be six months from date\nof issue.\n\n7. While the revised provisions deal only with passport issuance, the\nrequirement by the Government employees to obtain prior permission from\nhis/her Department / Ministry for travelling abroad as per Conduct Rules will\nremain unchanged as per the instructions issued by the Department of\nPersonnel & Training and respective authorities.\n\n8. Ministries of the Central Government, and the State Governments/ Union\nTerritories are requested to circulate these instructions to all the employees working\nunder them, including those in attached and subordinate re and statutory\n\nbodies. : Lb\n\n(Muktesh K.
