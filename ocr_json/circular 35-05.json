Any passenger refused entry into India is handed over to the \nconcerned air-carrier for removing him from Indian soil at the earliest as per ICAO \nconvention. Thereafter, it becomes the responsibility of the air-carrier to hold the \npassenger with them till his eventual removal. However, till such time the Airline could \narrange for removal, such passenger is detained in the Refusal/ Detention Room. \n \nTo ensure that such passenger does not  slip away from the airport, it is essential \nthat the refusal  room is guarded by the armed guards at the airport till the passenger is \ntaken out for boarding the aircraft. It has , therefore, been decided that a separate refusal \nroom for the purpose shall be earmarked by the AAI in consultation with the immigration \nauthorities at each international airport. Whenever there is a passenger in the guard room \nit will be guarded by CISF to ensure that the passenger does not escape from custody and \nis deported out of India. \n \n \n(R.C. Tayal) \nOffg. Commissioner of Security (Civil Aviation) \n \nDistribution: As per list attached."
