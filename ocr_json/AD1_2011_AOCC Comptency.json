  "5": "1 \n \n \n \n \nIntroduction \n \n \nIn recent years, the management of risks to safety has taken a significant \nevolutionary step, with safety management having a focus at the organisational and \nsystems level, with greater attention to the interfaces between the various elements of \nthe overall aviation system, including the human being.   \nICAO Standards for State adoption have been developed for Safety \nManagement Systems, and the DGCA is in the process of meeting its obligations in \nthat regard with recent and evolving Civil Aviation Regulations (CARs) for Indian \nairports.  These CARs include the need for service providers to confirm and \ndemonstrate their organisational competence; CAR Series F Section 4 refers (staff \nestablishment/competency).  \nThe DGCA recognizes that regulations which bring significant change can \ngenerate the need for complimentary guidance material. Consequently, the \nAerodrome Standards Directorate of the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) \nIndia has developed this Circular.  It is designed to assist Licensees in satisfying \nthemselves, in the first instance, of their organisational competence, using an \nanalysis of staffing establishment, qualification and experience needs, against the \noperational objectives, requirements and tasks, for all safety-critical functional areas.  \nThis is in addition to the provision of appropriate infrastructure, equipment and \ntechnical and management systems, in line with DGCA CARs.   Whilst the DGCA \nmay consider alternative means of complying with the competence element of the \nSeries F CAR, those means would have to give firm evidence of organisational \ncompetence to the same degree, and as identifiable as that detailed in this AD AC. \nThe advent of privatisation and the consequent commercially oriented \napproach to the management of licensed aerodromes has the potential to create \nsignificant change. Business driven objectives have assumed a higher priority and \nmanagement structures and skills have shifted towards a more business focused \nculture.  Change, even when beneficial, can be a generator of hazards which may be \nspecific or common to aerodromes.  \nThe practice of granting licenses to corporate bodies, with major decision \nmaking \nbeing \nheld \nat \ncorporate \nlevel \nrather \nthan \nto \nindividual \nairport \ncompanies/management, which is not in line with general accepted practice, will have \nits own hazard generators.  For example, if there is a practice of transferring staff \nbetween airports on a frequent and short-notice basis.   \nThese changes place an even greater emphasis on the Airport Licensee, the \nAccountable Executive at the airport, and senior management understanding their \naccountabilities and responsibilities in managing safety at their airports in a \nsystematic and organised manner.  Also, on the need for them to be able to give \nassurances, as part of those accountabilities and responsibilities, to the DGCA and \nothers about their organisation\u2019s capability and competence in securing the safety of \noperations at their airport, including: \n(a) \nThe necessary level of knowledge and understanding of safety \nmanagement principles at the highest level of senior management, as \nwell as at the more traditional line levels.  \n(b) \nThe transparent establishment of staff numbers through the use of",
  "6": "management tools, such as task analysis, for all safety-critical areas, \nincluding those contracted out.  \n(c) \nThe capability to demonstrate to external as well as internal auditors, \nthat staff establishment is continually being monitored, using internal \nmanagement systems.  Furthermore, that the establishment is adjusted \nto suit any increase in air traffic and safety demands placed on the \norganisation.   \nThe DGCA will expect evidence of this to be available during the issue of initial \nlicense as well as during planned and ad-hoc surveillance inspections, including \nsafety assurance for any significant change.  One way of showing staff establishment \nnumbers is to: \n(a) \nConstruct an organogram with the numbers of safety critical staff \nindicated; and \n(b) \nFor this to be continually reviewed and updated. \n \nBy ensuring that the appropriate knowledge and understanding is present at all \nlevels in an organisation there will be a greater probability of: \n\u0083 \nProviding stable and sustained organisational competence; \n\u0083 \nEnsuring improvements in safety performance; \n\u0083 \nPreventing any reduction in the priority attached to safety; and \n\u0083 \nProviding the necessary skills sets available in aviation operations at \nexecutive management level, as well as the line and lower levels.  \n \nPurpose \n \nThe aim of this document is to enable licensees to assess the level of operational \nsafety management competence existing within their respective airport organisations, \nincluding any areas that are contracted out, and to ensure that they have the necessary \nexpertise at the appropriate level to formulate and implement systems to adequately \nmanage safety.   \n \nTherefore, it addresses tasks at the senior to supervisory level in two Chapters, \nchapter 1 aimed at the senior management level and Chapter 2 at the line to supervisory \nlevel.  It does not cover tasks at the \u201coperative\u201d level.  However, licensees are encouraged \nto adapt and apply the material for this purpose; it is intended as a management tool to be \nused by licensees and their airport managements for internal use, not only as a \nmechanism to satisfy the safety regulator.  It should be noted that most of the topic areas \ncovered by this document are subject to specific safety regulation by the DGCA, but \nlicensees may wish to extend the principle to other areas for their own managerial \npurposes. \n \n2 \n \nAs recognized above, some tasks within the competences and some topic areas \nmay be \u2018contracted out\u2019 by the aerodrome licensee. Whilst day-to-day operational \nmanagement is the responsibility of such a contractor, the aerodrome licensee continues \nto have overall accountability and responsibility for the safe integration of contracted \nactivities with the rest of the aerodrome operation. A licensee, therefore, needs to ensure \nthat competence and safety management requirements are included in contract \nspecifications and documents, including those relating to:",
  "7": "3 \n \n \n \n \n\u0083 The maintenance of determined and declared staff/operative numbers; \n\u0083 Safety performance; and  \n\u0083 Appropriate supervision, monitoring and follow-up.  \nThis material: \n1. Takes account of the need to accommodate a range of licensed aerodromes and \ntheir varied scope of operations.  Not all of the tasks listed will be appropriate or \nnecessary for all aerodromes, an issue of particular interest to the smaller \naerodromes. Not all of the areas of competence have to be vested in one person, \nan issue of particular interest to the larger aerodromes. \n2. Will assist the aerodrome licensee to: \n(a) \nIdentify the post/s and person/s that have accountabilities and/or \nresponsibility for a specific task, including project managers, shift \nsupervisors and those monitoring the safety performance of contracted-out \nservices; \n(b) \nBe satisfied that persons within the management structure possess the \nrelevant operational safety competence, or identify gaps and, therefore, \ntraining needs, that may exist in specific areas of competence; \n(c) \nDevelop job specifications, training programmes, recruitment and \nsuccession planning; and \n(d) \nProvide, for aerodrome licensing purposes, the safety assurance sought \nby the DGCA on operational safety competence of the licensee\u2019s \norganisation. \n \nTerminology \n \n \nFor ease of interpretation, several key terms used throughout this document are \ndefined as follows: \n \nBackground Knowledge \u2013 The collective body of information and skill sets, gained \nthrough experience and training, that people need to have, if they are to perform their \nroles competently. This includes memorised relevant facts, regulations, theories and \nprinciples, and knowing where to find such data when it is not necessary to commit them \nto memory.  \n  \nEnsure \u2013 The dictionary meaning implies 100% guarantee, and this is the \nobjective.  It may be argued that an interpretation may at times be like safety risks \nbeing reduced to As Low As Reasonably Practicable (ALARP). However, that \ncannot and must not be an excuse for not making all reasonable efforts to \u201censure\u201d \nto the dictionary definition where possible. \n \nHazard \u2013 A condition or an object with the potential to cause injuries to personnel, \ndamage to equipment or structures, loss of material, or reduction of ability to perform \na prescribed function (ICAO 9859, Edition 2).",
  "8": "4 \n \n \n \n \nInfrastructure project - A building or structure (defined as arrangement of parts).  \nThis could be a new or upgrade of facilities, a replacement or refurbishment of an \nexisting facility or a major maintenance project that will cause operational \ndisruption over a significant period of time.  Such projects will have different \nsignificance in different contexts.  For example, in terms of obstacle limitation \nsurfaces height will be the significant element, whereas for wildlife management \nthe significant element will be attractiveness to wildlife. \n \nNamed Person \u2013 A person, identified by name, who currently holds a specified post. \n \nOrganisational Competence \u2013 Demonstrable capability of the organisation to \nsecure the safety of  aircraft using the airport, having regard to the provision of \nequipment, facilities, management systems, documentation and staff.  The staff \nestablishment must be: \n \n\u0083 \nSufficient in terms of numbers for each of the functional areas; and  \n\u0083 \nSuitably qualified and experienced with the appropriate combination of \nskill-sets for the tasks expected of them. \n \nThis applies equally to staff for functions that are outsourced; functions for which \nthe licensee remains accountable, in terms of aerodrome licence obligations.   \n \nRisk, specifically Safety Risk - A measure of the seriousness of, or \u201cput a number\u201d \non, the consequences of hazards, expressed in terms of predicted probability and \nseverity, of the consequences of a hazard ((ICAO 9859, edition 2). \n \nSafety Assurance Report - A structured argument, supported by a body of evidence \nthat provides a compelling, understandable and valid case that change in a \nsystem/sub-system meets the service providers risk acceptability and change \nmanagement criteria for a given application in a given operating environment.  It is \nmore than risk management, or even a safety assessment, as it includes in its scope \nthe outcomes of activities and assurances required by the change management \nprocess, such as testing prior to entry-into- service.  Depending on the nature of the \napplication and operating environment a safety case may meet the requirement for a \nsafety assurance report. \n \nSpecified Post \u2013 A post within an aerodrome management structure, which has been \nidentified as having responsibility for the management of a specific safety related task.  \nWhere more than 1 post has responsibility for the task then all the posts and post-\nholders need to be identified and reviewed against the background knowledge. \n \nTask \u2013 An area of work for which a defined competence is deemed necessary. \n \n \nApplication \n \n \nThe Accountable Executive at the aerodrome, as the person with overall \naccountability for safety management, or an appropriately delegated person, should \nidentify which areas of competence and tasks are relevant to their aerodrome. To assist \nthat person a check list format has been developed throughout the document.",
