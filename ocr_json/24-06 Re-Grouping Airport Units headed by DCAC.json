Dated. 22- Nov\u201906\n\nCIRCULAR NO. AS-242006\nSubject: RE-GROUPING AIRPORT UNITS HEADED BY DC/AS.\n\nWhile visiting the Airport Units, it has been noticed that many urgent\ncommunications like representations against transfers or other important proposals from\nthe Unit Comdrs have been held up in the offices of various Gp. Comdts. as these\ncommunications were routed by the AC/DC headed Units through them. This, in turn,\ndelays the decision making process and causes administrative confusion.\n\n2. In this context, | would like to remind all the AC/DC led ASGs that these\nunits were grouped under various Gp. Comdts. for the purpose of statutory\nfunctions in the area of disciplinary proceedings, financial matters etc. The\nGroup Comdts. in the Airport Sector were not meant/conceived to be a part of the\nregular hierarchy. As a result, they were not supposed to perform any\noperational role vis-a-vis the AC/DC headed Airports grouped under them and\nthey were not also supposed to carry out any inspections. of these units.\nTherefore, the designated Gp. Comat. with respect to the Airport Units will only\nperform the role assigned to them as indicated above. The regular hierarchy for\nmost of the matters will consist only all the Airport Unit heads, the DisG/ADIsG of\nAirport Zones and the IG/Airport Sector. Further, in order to take quick decision\nin time bound matters, a copy of the communication sent to the DisG/ADIsG will\nalso be marked to IG/AS.\n\n.
