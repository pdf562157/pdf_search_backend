On perusal of\nthe recent resurvey reports received from the units, it is seen that no uniform\ncriteria in projecting/assessing the requirement of manpower for various duty\nposts and operational requirement is being followed for the airport units. It is\ntherefore felt that there should be rationale and uniformity in deployment\nwhich should be projected while assessing the manpower for the airport\nunits.\n\nTherefore, an effort has been made here to develop a criteria for\nmanpower deployment in the airports units. Whenever a resurvey of an\nairport is being carried out for assessing the manpower requirement,\nfollowing duty posts must necessarily be included while deciding the security\narrangements of an airport:-\n\nSN Area/Duty post Deployment\n1 City side patrolling 01-H/Const, 01-Const in each shift.\n2 Alighting point 01-Const (armed with small weapon) in each\n\noperational shift.\n3 Spotters/Marshals 02-Const in each operational shift in civil dress\n. (with 9mm carbine or AK-47 arms) inside each\n\nterminal building\n4 Pre-embarkation 06-S! (02-Lady SI/Exe) +1 Const per x-ray\nsecurity check (01 machine, i.e. -2-Sls for X-ray, 2 for frisking\nInspector will be booths and 2 for physical checking of hand\nexclusively I/C of baggage, Constable will be for hand baggage\n\nSHA per lifting.\noperational shift)\n\n6. - Departure entry 01-SI, 01-H/Const or Const in each\ngate operational shift\n\n6.
