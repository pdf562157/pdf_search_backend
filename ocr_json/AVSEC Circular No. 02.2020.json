  "6": "ANNEXURE-A\n1. Introduction\nUnmanned Aircraft (UA) or Remotely Piloted Aircraft System (RPAS),commonly\nknown as \"Drone\" is considered to be a game-changer technology in modem life.\nDrones are being extensively used for various applications. However, drones may also\nbe used for destnrctive purposcs such as delivering explosives and harmful cargo for\ncrcating havoc etc.\nDrones also have the potential for disrupting manned aircraft movements especially in\nthe proximiiy to airports. There are numerous examples of hours-long hold up of\nairport operations due drone sightings like Gatwick and Dubai airports' Such incidents\nhave led the aviation community and security agencies io consider the deployment of\ncounter-drone systems by airport opelators to protect airports and their proximities to\nprotect the airports from rogue drones\n2. System Description\nThe Counler Drone System should provide Multi Sensor based complete and\ncomprehensive solution with regards to drotre detection, tracking, identification and\nneutralization (Soft Kilts and Hard kill options). Soft-kill options rvill not work if the\nunmanned aircraft employs navigation tlrough INS or VPS and is not remotely\npiloted i.e. fully autonomous. I:lence the neutralization by hard kill measures such as\nlaser, and Fire Control locking system is inevitable. The decision to employ' such hard\nkill measures shall be depending on the si(uations and specific to the airport as per\nSOP. The hard kill option will be the last resort for drone neutralization. If the hard\nkitl option is decided then, the laser will be the first hard kill option for drone\nneutralization\nThe solution should integrare detection, identification and engagement sub-systems\nand provide operator with a composite air situational picture as well as tools for\nmanaging response.\nThe salient features of Counter Drone system are given belorv\nThe Counter UAV solution should be effective and efficient in all-rvcather\nconditions with minimum of 95% detection and neutralization probability of all\ndrones with or without RF command and conkol and data link.\nThe C-UAS solution should simultaneously detect, identifu and neutralize\nmultiple / swarm of drones (minimum 20 Nos).\nOperation of the counter drone solution in no case should interfere with RF\nenvironment of Airport operations.\nb.\nSYSTEM (UAS) / REMOTELY PILOTED AIRCRAI'T (RPA) SYSTEM\nPage2ot l0",
