It occurs in a variety of formats including chat rooms, web blogs, social\nblogs, internet fora, pictures, videos, social networking etc. These are not\nlimited to Facebook, Linkedin, YouTube, WhatsApp, Twitter and Instagram etc.\nSocial media provides an easy medium for our adversaries to identify, monitor,\ntarget and gain information of value which is detrimental to the internal or\nnational security of India. The Force personnel often use social media to\ndiscuss professional issues or share information about their organization,\nnature of work, deployment etc. This not only leads to unnecessary disclosure\nof sensitive information but also exposes vital and strategic information.\nCyber-criminals use advanced techniques to gather intelligence from such\npublic forums and communities. Such information enables them to mount\ncyber attacks by impersonation, spoofing or other social engineering attacks.\n\nThe exigent need to sensitise all ranks (especially senior officers) and\ntheir families regarding the trending threats, sophistication and range of\nscams that are designed to invade privacy and hack into systems and\naccounts needs no emphasis. There is also a need for self-regulation on the\ncontent which is posted on social media platforms and shared with friends and\ncontacts.\n\nlofS\n",
