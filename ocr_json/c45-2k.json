The lower bowl \u2013 section containing the \nexplosive material is a metallic material and smaller upper portion, which \ncontains the detonator, is a plastic composite material.  The screener did not \ndetect the object as a grenade, though metal pin and spoon component appeared to \nresemble the trigger section of a handgun. \n \n3. \nThe overriding factor in determining the object\u2019s true identity was the orientation \nof the grenade as it passed, through the X-ray Unit.  When the grenade was on its \nside it was easily identifiable.  But when the grenade was sanding on end, top or \nbottom, the image presented was that of a round to slightly oval object.  There \nwere no distinguishing features that would identify the object as an explosive \ndevice. \n \n4. \nA Motorola cellular flip phone, with 2 large, sturdy paper clips bent in to \nimprovised hand cuff keys and a 3 \u00bc inch razar sharp, single edge blade possibly \nfrom a wall paper were detected during X-ray recently. \n \n5. \nIn another case a .22 caliber pistol, hidden inside a cellular telephone were found \nby inspectors at Hidalgo. \n \n6. \nPhoto copies of the device are enclosed herewith.  The personnel engaged in \nsecurity be briefed accordingly, instructed to be more vigilant / watchful towards \nsuch concealment while discharging duties on X-ray BIS. \n  \n (R.K.Singh) \nADDL.COMMISSIONER OF SECURITY (CA) \n \nNO.CAS-15(12)/2000-DIV-II, Dated : 01.01.2001",
