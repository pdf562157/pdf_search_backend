The BTAC then would fill box 2 (Positive\nTarget Identification) which will determine the Bomb Threat call be specific, if\neven one question is ticked as \u2018YES\u2019 in this column.

If there is the slightest doubt, the coordinator must tum to\n\u2018one of the other options.\n\n2: ind then evaluate if n\n\nThis choice means, of course, that people will be in the terminal building\nfor a longer period should there be a bomb present. However, if a bomb is found,\nthey can then be evacuated away from danger. If nothing is found and there are\nno other significant factors, the coordinator may consider this option appropriate\nif assessing the threat level as low.\n\nOption 3: Search and partial evacuation\n\nWhen the threat level is considered to be moderate but there is no reason\nto believe an explosion may be imminent, or if the suspect device Is small (e.g. a\nletter bomb) and parts of the terminal building may be some considerable\ndistance from the device, the coordinator might consider evacuating part of the\nterminal building alone or retaining only essential staff and search teams within\nthe terminal building.\n\nOption 4: Evacuate immediately\n\n{a) If @ call is received which the coordinator considers to indicate the\nexistence of a high risk, there will be a case for evacuating as quickly as possible\nwithout conducting a search, especially where there is @ possibilty of an\nimminent explosion\n\n(b) When the time of explosion has been disclosed in a threat call, the\ncoordinator must ensure that any searches are finished and staff cleared al least\n20 minutes before the deadline, irrespective of whether any device has been\nfound or not.\n\nEvacuation plans\nAs in the case of search plans, the coordinator should have up-to-date drawings\n\nof evacuation routes. This is especially necessary when there are a number of exits\nfrom the terminal building. The purpose is two fold,\n\n(a) To evacuate as quickly and efficiently as possible using all available exits.\nA public address system can help in directing staff to particular exits. When no\nother form of communication is available, the fire alarm can be used providing\nthat it can be sounded in a way which distinguishes it from a fire warning, that\nRESTRICTED\n29\n\n",

Use of the fire alarm is\n\u2018poor alternative to a public address system and should only be employed\n\u2018temporarily pending the installation of something better.\n\n{b) To provide alternative routes for evacuation so that people can leave the\nterminal building without being placed in danger by passing close to the suspect\nexplosive device. For example, if there are four evacuation routes but one of the\nroutes runs closer to a suspect explosive device than the others, the coordinator\ncan decide at once to evacuate using the other routes \u2018only.\n\n(\u00a9 To ensure the safe evacuation of the public, the coordinator should\n\u2018consider using members of the staff as \u201cEvacuation Marshals\" to ensure that the\npublic can leave quickly and without panic by the pre-selected routes. Evacuation\nmarshals need to be selected in advance and trained in their role.\n\n(4) The evacuation plan should also show two designated assembly areas in\n\u2018opposite directions where people should congregate after evacuation\n\u2018Sometimes fire assembly points can be utilized for this purpose, as long as they\nfare located at a minimum 400 m from the terminal building. In some\ncircumstances, assembly areas may need to be up to 1000 m away from the\nbuilding. BDDS advice should be sought as to whether this is necessary.\n\n(e) Ideally, all employees and members of the public should be asked to take\npersonal belongings and baggage which Is stil in their possession with them,\nSince this will help to avoid unnecessary suspicion over articles of property left\nbehind after evacuation. However, this will be difficult to implement unless. @\npublic address system or other suitable means of communication is readily\navailable and used properly.\n\noO Personnel and passengers who have been evacuated may have to\nremain outside for a long time before the terminal building is declared safe, so it\nis best ff shelter can be provided under cover. It may be possible to seek\naccommodation by arrangement in altemative buildings. This provides the\nopportunity to shelter from weather, maintain good communication and cater to\nindividual needs.\n\n(@) If possible, car parks should not be designated as assembly areas,\n\n\u2018especially if they are adjacent to the evacuated terminal building since they may\ncontain secondary explosive devices hidden within vehicies.\n\nRESTRICTED\n\n",

If the media are denied all information they will\nbecome frustrated and unlikely to cooperate with police requests.

There should be separate facilities, to deal with the public who will be making\n\u2018enquiries concerning persons involved in the incident. A Telephone and information\nCentre (TIC) will need to be set up, which need not be necessarily at the incident site,\nwith a dedicated telephone number, and trained staff, to cope with the high volume of\ncalls from public, relatives and friends of persons involved. Incoming overseas calls in\ndifferent languages should be expected.
