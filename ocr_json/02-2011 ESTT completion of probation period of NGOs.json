When a probationer is awarded any punishment during the period of\nprobation, his probation is extended for six months or one year. However,\ncompletion of probation is not a formality and it should not be extended as a matter\nof routine. In case an official is exhibiting misconduct / indiscipline which makes\nhim unfit for holding such a post in an Armed Force of the Union then the option of,\nreversion / termination should be seriously considered.\n\n02. Therefore, all IsG / DisG are directed to keep a strict watch on personnel\nwhose probation period is extended. The existing powers to discharge probationers\nof all ranks from Constable (Follower) to Inspectors as per Rule - 25 (2) of CISF\nRules, 2001 should be systematically and vigorously used at Sector Level in case of\nNGOs so that the necessity of dispensing with the services of employees at later\nstages may arise only rarely.\n\n03. A similar watch and supervision would be applicable to Gazetted Officers\nwhose probation is cleared by Pers.
