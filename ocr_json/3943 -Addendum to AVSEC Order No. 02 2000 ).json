The idea is that the CCTV camera should be able to digitally capture the image\nof the boarding pass as well as identity (not the Identity Card) of the passenger. Therefore,\nthe correct placement of the CCTV camera is very important.\n4. \nIt is suggested that the CCTV camera can be placed somewhere near the Queuing\nAssistant duty poirt, because after this the passenger is supposed to place his mobile phone in\nthe X-BIS input roller. l-lowever, any other appropriate ,ocation may also be decided locally.\n5. \nPassenger may be advised to hold his/her mobile/paper boardirE pass beiore the ccw\nCamera in such a manner that image of boarding pass as well as passenger is captured\nproperly.\n6. \nAll CASOS are also directed to adequately sensitize all GO In-Charges, SHA I/G and\nscreeners. The SHA I/C and GO should actively be presert in this area to resolve any complaint\nreqarding taking a photograph of the passenger and his/her boarding pass. A copy of the\nabove BCAS AVSEC Order should also be readily available in SHA for addressing any passenger\ngrievance.\n7. \nAll airline operators should also be sensitized about this change in security procedure by\ncondEting a special APSC (Airport Security Committee) meeting along with all stakeholders.\n8. \nIssued for strict compliarce.\nEncl: As above.\nl\\,\n(M.
