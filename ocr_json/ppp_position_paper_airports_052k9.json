The civil aviation traffic has seen an unprecedented traffic in the past few years on \naccount of booming Indian economy, growing tourism industry, entry of low cost carriers \nin the private sector, liberalization of international bi-lateral agreements and liberalization \nof civil aviation policy.  In future also the civil aviation traffic is expected to grow at the  \nsame pace despite current slowdown due to global recession.  But airport infrastructure \nhas not kept pace with the growth of the civil aviation traffic. This has resulted in \ncongestion and inefficient services in major airports, limited landing slots, inadequate \nparking bays and congestion during peak hours for airlines.  Development of quality \ninfrastructure will have an impact on international competitiveness and economic growth.  \nThis requires faster development of civil aviation infrastructure on public private \npartnership mode.  In tune with the requirement many initiatives have already been \nstarted in the 10th five year plan and they are expected to continue in the 11th plan also.     \n2. Of a total number of 454 airports and airstrips in India, 16 are designated as international \nairports. The Airports Authority of India (AAI) owns and operates 97 airports. A recent \nreport by Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation (CAPA) states that over the next 12 years, \nIndia's Civil Aviation Ministry aims at 500 operational airports. The Government aims to \nattract private investment in aviation infrastructure. India has been witnessing a very \nstrong phase of development in the past few years. Many domestic as well as \ninternational players are showing interest in the growth and development of the aviation \nsector with immense focus on the development of the airports. With the opening up of the \ndomestic skies to private carrier in the second half of the Tenth Plan, air services have \nbecome affordable and are now competing with other modes of transport. Propelled by \neconomic growth and liberalization, the sector experienced an unprecedented growth \nduring the Tenth Plan, especially during the last three years. Indian private airlines \u2013 \nKingfisher, Jet, IndiGo, Spice jet, Go Air, Paramount - account for around 84% of the \ndomestic passenger traffic. Some have now started international flights. For the next \nyears to come India is poised with strong focus on the development of its airports to meet \nthe international standards. The government is planning modernization of the airports to",

Under the new proposed civil aviation policy, the Ministry of Civil Aviation has \nsuggested the establishment of an Essential Air Services Fund (EASF) to provide subsidy \nto airlines that operate on \u2018uneconomical but essential routes\u2019 such as the North-east.  \nWith the success of Universal Services Obligation (USO) of the telecom sector, the \ngovernment is of the view that the subsidy support from the fund should be provided \nthrough a transparent process of minimum subsidy bidding.  Under this system, the \nbidder who asks for the minimum subsidy from the fund will win the maximum number \nof routes.  This would enable subsidies to be paid to the most efficient operator at the \nlowest cost to the public and might lead to the development of specialized smaller airlines \nas well, the policy states.  The fund, however, is to be created through a cess levied on \nboth domestic and international air travel.  After the new system is put in place, the route \ndispersal guidelines would be progressively replaced.  The current route dispersal \nguidelines of the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) make it mandatory for \nall scheduled carriers to deploy at least 10 per cent of the total capacity of their trunk \nroutes on Tier II routes comprising the North-East, Jammu and Kashmir, Andaman & \nNicobar Islands, and Lakshadweep. \nAir India Restructuring \n15.

The \nproject is being implemented by Bengal Aerotropolis Projects Ltd.  Changi Airports \nInternational of Singapore has 26 stake in the project   The project is expected to be \ncompleted by 2011-12 with a project cost of Rs 10,000 crs on a land of 2,300 acres.  The \nfocus is on cargo, supply chain, logistic hub with maintenance, repair and night parking \nfacilities.       \nAir Cargo Ports \n32. The government plans to raise the FDI cap in air cargo business to 74 per cent as part of \nefforts to further open up the sector for foreign investment.  There is huge opportunity in \nthe cargo business.  According to the civil aviation ministry, Nagpur should be made the \ncargo hub of the country because of its geographical advantage.  The central government \nmay provide all required support to make it a truly world class cargo hub.",
  "18": "Page | 18 \n \nRegional Airlines \n33. To improve  regional connectivity and create regional hubs, the Civil Aviation ministry \nhas mooted a proposal to set up \u2018regional airlines\u2019, defined as carriers with aircraft having \nless than 80 seats and which operate exclusively on regional routes from any one \nmetropolitan airport, which includes Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata, Bangalore and \nHyderabad.  The ministry has also suggested that the first airline to connect cities that are \nnot linked by air should be exempt from all airport and navigation charges at both airports \nfor the first year of operation.  For regional airlines, navigation and landing charges often \nconstitute up to 10 per cent of the overall costs (Source: India Infrastructure Report 2008. \nPP.28)      \nNew Opportunities \n34. Private sector participation in airports has given rise to new opportunities for new \nbusinesses.  GMR Infrastructure Ltd, which has MIAL concession, has made its first \nforay in the international arena.  A joint consortium that includes the GMR Infrastructure \nLtd has bagged the contract to develop Sabiha Goken International Airport in Instanbul.  \nThe BOT project includes not only the construction of a new international terminal \nwithin thirty months capable of handling 10 million passengers annually but also \nmanaging the existing domestic and international terminals.   \n35. The GMR Group plans to set up an airport based SEZ near the new Hyderabad \nInternational Airport, which it has the mandate to develop.  Planned on the lines of free \ntrade zones in Hamburg and Dubai, the SEZ will house aircraft component \nmanufacturing industries and also see high end aircraft engineering support activities.  \nBesides, the SEZ will house high end electrical and auto component manufacturing \nfacilities and software units.  The group also has plans to set up high precision \npharmaceutical equipment manufacturing to cash in on international air connectivity.  If \nallowed, the GMR group has plans to develop aereotropolis-new \u2018cities\u2019 springing up \naround airports a new concept which is seeded in an urban hubs.  An aerotropolis offers \noperational convenience for companies and organizations to maximize benefits, while \ncutting down on expenditure significantly.  The GMR group would like to give the \nconcept concrete shape around the new Hyderabad airport.  The airport is going to be the",
  "19": "Page | 19 \n \nnucleus of the country\u2019s first aerotropolis, a new urban form that would house business \nparks, hotels, residential units, and entertainment areas.  The GMR group, which also \nbagged the international airport project at Delhi with Fraport of Germany, will develop \nthe aerotropolis near Delhi airport as well (The Hindu, 12 February 2007).  Maharashtra \nAirport Development Company (MADC) is also developing an SEZ at the Nagpur \nairport.  Cochin International Airport (CIAL) has approved a 480 acres land utilization \nplan for an aircraft maintenance facility, an aviation academy, and a golf course, among \nother things. (Source: The Infrastructure Sector in India 2007, pp.29). \n \n5 \nCONSTRAINTS \nSUPPLY SIDE CONSTRAINTS \nLong Term Funds:  \n36. The Infrastructure projects which are executed on PPP in Airport Sector are with a \nconcession period of 30 years are more.  The Project development takes around 24 to 36 \nmonths.  Considerable revenue generation takes place only in the years 10 to 20.  But the \nFinancial institutions lending horizon is between 8 to 12 years due to average maturity of \nthe deposits or the borrowed amount.  This gap needs to be addressed on an urgent basis \n37. The following recommendations could be considered to address the supply side \nconstraints vis-vis long term funds \nAirport Finance Corporation \nSetting up of an Airport Finance Corporation on the lines of Power Finance \nCorporation is required.  This can facilitate lower interest rates and longer \nmaturity of loans.  Dedicated amount will be set aside for this sector. \nNon Taxable Bonds \nLong Term Funds may be allowed to be raised through Non Taxable \nInfrastructure Bonds by the financial institutions for funding in the airport sector.  \nThere may be certain period of lock in for the invested amount.  This facility may \nbe allowed until the required amount of gap in investment in airport sector is",
  "20": "Page | 20 \n \nbridged. \nRange of Incentives \nThe range of incentives available to the PPP projects in airport sector should be \nspecified upfront.  On a case to case basis, each PPP project will announce the \nbunch of incentives available for that particular project to make the project \ncommercially viable.  This brings clarity to all the parties to the project.  The list \nof incentives can be increased or decreased as growth in the sector takes \nmomentum. \nSeparate limit for External Commercial Borrowing \nThere should be separate sectoral limit for airport sector for utilizing External \nCommercial Borrowing.  Because of the bunching with other sectors, the amount \nof inflow to the airport sector may not be that significant.  The cap in the interest \nrate may also be raised in case the amount is for subordinated debt and Mezzanine \nfinancing. \nSeparate limit for investment in debt market by FIIs \nThere should be sectoral limit in investment in debt market by FIIs.  This will stop \ncrowding in some particular sectors.  The sector limits brings in reasonable \nallocation to all sectors.  There will be balanced development in all sectors. \nDisinvestment of Equity and the Tax concession \nThere should be separate and comprehensive guidelines in respect of \ndisinvestment of equity by the developers and the tax treatment thereon.  As most \nof the infrastructure projects are handled by Special Purpose Vehicles, the \ntreatment in case of dividend declaration by parent company and the SPV should \nbe seen holistically without the burden of double taxation.     \n  \n \nDEMAND SIDE CONSTRAINTS",
  "21": "Page | 21 \n \nShelf of Bankable Projects \n38. Shelf of Bankable Projects should be prepared on a continuous basis.  These should be \nbidded out as per the demand, risk appetite of the developers, present market scenario.  \nThese shelves of Bankable Projects should be kept in the website and intimated to the \nprospective developers.  Depending on the number of hits or enquiries or interests \nprojects may be bidded out. Recently some of the bids called in the airport sector has not \nelicited any response. \nPOLICY CONSTRAINTS \nStandard Documentation \n39. Bidding documents like Request for Qualification (RFQ), Request for Proposal (RFP), \nModel Concession Agreement (MCA), and various Legal Documents should be \nstandardized.  This will reduce the time taken for the bidding process.  This will also give \na fair idea to the prospective developers about bidding criteria.  Because of \nstandardization, the bidders time in preparation of bidding documents will come down, \nresulting in time and cost saving.  \nVision Document \u2013 Airport Sector  \nA comprehensive Infrastructure Vision Document for Airport Sector should be prepared \nwith a investment of horizon of next 20 to 30 years.  This document also should contain \nshort term action plan of next 5 years and next 10 years.  The document should clearly \nspell out the infrastructure gaps in the airport sector at present and possible areas of \ndevelopment.  The linkage infrastructure investment should be spelt out.  The total \ninvestment requirement and how it can be raised should also be mentioned. \nEmpanelment of Transaction Advisors \n40. Certain sectors like Road sector, Tourism Sector, Urban Infrastructure sector have \nempanelled Transaction Advisors with core competency in that particular sector.  This \nmay be done in the airport sector also.  This may reduce the time in selecting the \nTransaction Advisors; it may catalyze consultants to become sector specific experts.  \nThese TAs may be taken on nomination basis for initial handholding purposes up to a \nlimit of certain amount.  The present TAs empanelled with DEA can be used only to the",
  "22": "Page | 22 \n \nprojects whose cost is up to Rs 250 cr.  The TAs are also general in nature and not sector \nspecific.  \nLand Acquisition and R&R Policy \n41. Airports generally required large tracks of contiguous land.  In case of international \nairports the requirement will be much larger.  There is lot of criticism that more land is \nacquired than the required for the project.  There is also lot of criticism that the amount \npaid as compensation is not adequate.  There should be proper and comprehensive \nguidelines in respect of how much land is required for a particular airport and the way to \npay the compensation.  The project affected people should be made as partners in the \nproject. The guidelines also should include how to handle the issues in case land \nacquisition involves religious structures.  It is a very sensitive issue.   \nFor example Kolkata Airport faced lot of problem in extending its second runway as an \nancient mosque is situated next to the runway.  Resistance to shift this religious \nstructure forced the airport authorities to redraw the entire map to upgrade the \nKolkata Airport.  This involved acquisition of an extra 25,000 square metres of land, \nspending of crores of rupees on building a detour and payment of compensation to \nseveral high rise buildings.   \nReplicable Models on Airport Sector \n42. Data should be made available about the successful and replicable models both within the \ncountry and internationally.  The lessons learned from previous experience should be \nwell documented so that the possible pitfalls can be avoided.   The documents used in \nthat particular model also should be made available. \nSingle window approval \n43. All the required approvals for the developing an airport should be through one \ngovernment agency. Multiple agencies (Refer Appendix II) will delay the project.  Since \none approval is linked to other approvals, the entire chain gets delayed due to delay in \none approval.  Dedicated officer for the airport should be identified from the government \nto make the entire process smooth. \nSTRUCTURAL CONSTRAINTS \nIntegration of the Airport with Main City",
  "23": "Page | 23 \n \n44. The major airports in India are mostly at considerable distance from the city centre.  They \nare developed at one end of the city.  Sometimes to connect to the other end of the city, \nthe distance is as high as 50 to 60 kms.  One of the major challenges at present for certain \nairports like Hyderabad International Airport is integration with the main city.  The \nairport should be seamlessly integrated with the main city / important areas of the main \ncity with dedicated rail, roads, Buses, Taxis, autos.  The connecting infrastructure should \nbe made available before the airport comes into operation.  Delhi Airport is setting an \nexample for rest of the airports by connecting Delhi Metro with Delhi Airport seamlessly.  \nPassengers can check in with and without baggage at various designated stations of the \ndedicated Delhi Metro Line.  Similarly a high speed rail link is being planned to connect \nthe Bangalore Main City to the Bangalore International Airport.  There will be airport \ncheck in counter in the city itself.    \nCapacity Building \n45. PPP being a new concept, there should be a mechanism for continuous up gradation of \nskills.  Various cadres of officers should be trained in all aspects of the PPP Projects.  \nThere should be lot of sharing of information about both the successful models as well as \nfailed models.  Repository of information should be built continuously.  Guiding \nmaterials, tool kits should be made available to the participants.  Lead Financing \nInstitutions and Bankers should be involved in the capacity building exercise. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n6 \nTHE WAY FORWARD",
  "24": "Page | 24 \n \nIn addition to addressing the above mentioned various constraints, the following are \nsome more initiatives which can further enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of \nservice delivery.  They will bring in growth in the air traffic and attract more \ninvestment through private players \n \nSetting up of an Aviation University \n46.  The passenger air traffic is expected to increase from the present of level of 96 million in \n2006-07 to 316 million by 2022-23.  This tremendous growth requires large number of \ntrained pilots, technicians, air staff, and ground staff.  Setting up of a separate Aviation \nUniversity will continuously produce trained manpower and also impart continuous \ntraining to the existing staff. \nSynergy between Aviation Industry and Tourism Industry \n47. 97% of the country\u2019s foreign tourists arrive by air and tourism is the nation\u2019s second \nlargest foreign exchange earner.   There is a tremendous potential for tourism in national \nand international level.  Setting up of  Helipads in various tourist places and important \nreligious places will increase tourism and will also increase the air traffic.  The mainline \nair traffic and the feeder sector should be synchronized properly       \nDemand Analysis \n48. The closer the traffic numbers from the demand analysis, to the real numbers, the greater \nis the success of a PPP project.  The robustness of a demand analysis depends upon how \nwell the future developments in and around the PPP Project is factored into during the \nentire period of concession period.  In airport sector, there are several developments \nexpected to take place simultaneously.  In addition to several new airports in major cities, \n35 non-metro airports, several regional airports are expected to be developed in the next \nfew years.  As per CAPA report 500 operational airports are expected to be developed in \nthe next 12 years from the current position of 97 airports.  These airports not only cater to \nthe additional air traffic, but eat away a portion of the existing air traffic.          \n \nWay of Fixing of the Project Cost",
  "25": "Page | 25 \n \n49. If the project is developed completely by Government, the project parameters are set as \nper the requirement of the user public.  If the same project is developed under PPP, \nproject parameters are set at international standards.  This will unnecessarily raise the \nproject cost, user charges and the government subsidy.   This aspect should be taken into \nconsideration while fixing the project parameters \nCapturing the value created by the Airport \n50. Generally the value of the land which is surrounding the project goes up substantially \nduring the course of development of the project.  If part of the value addition in the land \n& buildings is captured as project development fee though stamp duty, government could \nbenefit substantially.  The captured amount can be utilised for other infrastructure \nprojects.  \nCross subsidy in Development of an Airport \n51. Many of the airports which are expected to be developed in non-metro areas, small cities \nand towns may not be financially viable.  Here air side development may be done on \nBOT Annuity and the non airside and the Operation and Maintenance may be done on \nBOT revenue sharing basis. \nPermission for Foreign Airlines to participate in Equity  \nWith a view to attracting new technology and management expertise, permission may be \ngiven to Foreign Airlines to participate in equity of Private Airlines.     \nDevelopment of Integrated Cargo Infrastructure  \nToday, about 40% of the world\u2019s cargo business, in terms of value, moves by air. \nAlthough cargo traffic is growing steadily in recent years it has not kept pace with the \npassenger traffic growth because of shortcomings such as lack of facilities for \ntransshipment of imports and exports; absence of integrated cargo infrastructure; \ndeficiencies in gateway and hinterland connectivity through rail and road; complexities in \ncustom procedures in air cargo; and need for technological up gradation and performance \nbased service standards.  \nDevelopment of Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul (MRO) Hub",
  "26": "Page | 26 \n \nAt present, there is virtually no credible third-party MRO facility in India to support the \nrequirements of the rapidly expanding aircraft fleets of private operators.  Part of the \nmaintenance is outsourced to foreign companies.   Owing to the availability of skilled \nmanpower, India has the potential to emerge as an MRO hub in Asia Pacific region.  \nIndia has become a manufacturing and exporting hub of automobiles in a short span of \ntime.  Airports should also look at becoming a global manufacturing and exporting hub of \nnot only aircraft parts but also aircrafts itself on PPP mode.  With availability of vast land \naround the airports and the plenty incentives available under the SEZ act this is quite \npossible.  Investment by the private sector including foreign direct investment would be \nencouraged to this end. \nMaking Route Dispersal Guidelines (RDG) Obligation Tradable \n52. To make the air operation business more commercially viable and to attract more private \nair operators the obligation under RDG may be made tradable. Alternatively, the routes \nmay be bifurcated into commercially viable and commercially non viable.  The \ncommercially non viable routes may be offered with incentives or with subsidy.    \nAir Connectivity in NER and Other Remote/Inaccessible Areas \n53. To increase the reach and the air traffic, the remote and inaccessible areas in the North \nEastern Region and other parts of the country should be encouraged with focus on \ninfrastructure and subsidy to the air operators under a special scheme. \n \nIncreasing Air Transport Security and reducing the chances of Air Accidents \n54. To decrease the chances of air collision and to increase the air transport security, the legal \nand institutional framework for civil aviation security needs to be strengthened by \nevolving appropriate technology, training, and equipments. \nValue for Money (VFM) \n55. Determining Value for Money (VFM) is very important before bidding out the \nInfrastructure Project to the private developer.  A key tool in determining value for \nmoney is the Public Sector Comparator (PSC).  The PSC tests whether a bid offers value \nfor money in comparison with the most efficient and likely form of public sector",
  "27": "Page | 27 \n \ndelivery. The VFM test is important as the Airport Authority of India can compete with \nthe private sector to redesign existing airports or build Greenfield airports \nSpeeding up of PPP Projects \n56. Initially six airports have come up on PPP mode.  They are all successfully operated now.  \nThis momentum should be maintained on taking forward 35 non metro airports, no-frills \nand low cost airports, merchant airports, air cargo ports and other new airports at various \nplaces.   The existing airport infrastructure gap needs to be filled up by bidding out \ncontinuously more and more airport infrastructure projects on PPP.       \nConclusion \n57. The task at hand is very huge.  Though there is a temporary lull in the traffic due to \nglobal recession, but in the long run, growth in both the air passenger traffic and air cargo \ntraffic is expected to leave a huge gap in desired airport infrastructure.  This challenge \ncan be addressed through formulation of a comprehensive airport infrastructure plan, \nformulation of policies and guidelines, changes in the existing policies and guidelines, \nformulation of comprehensive financing plan, Spelling out the range of incentives and \nconcessions, coming out with standard documents, creation of shelf of Bankable Projects, \nempanelment of sector specific transaction advisors, continuous publication of replicable \nmodels, continuous updation of skills through capacity building.  All these initiatives will \nenable the development of airport infrastructure on PPP to meet the growing demand of \nairport traffic and offer the globally comparable service standards at competitive rates. \n=======",

The existing staff is not interested in joining the private airport developer.  There is a plan now to downsize the existing \nstaff who are not willing to join the private airport developer through an attractive voluntary retirement scheme (VRS).
