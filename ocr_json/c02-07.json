The \ncurrent airport complexes are a cluster of buildings spread over many acres of \nland. Security agencies are handling the most difficult task of ensuring safety of \nboth assets and people with available resources and a largely manual system for \nidentification of personnel. \n \nEntry/exit gates are manned by officers and men of CISF/APSU and IDs \nof all personnel entering into the building are physically checked by this para-\nmilitary force. At present personnel are issued simple plastic ID cards, called \nAirport Entry Pass (AEP) for accessing the secured areas in the buildings, based \non a designed colour coding scheme. The personnel may exit/enter the buildings \nany number of times while they are on duty and may go to public places for \nrefreshment etc. at any time. \n \nAs the personnel are manually checked there are many possibilities of \nhuman errors thereby compromising security. The current Plastic Identification \ncard is not a fully secure media and can be easily duplicated. There is no \nmechanism to monitor the movement of personnel inside the premises and no \nmeans of knowing whether the individual is on duty. There is also the possibility \nof unauthorized individuals entering the premises using forged, stolen, or expired \nidentification cards or gaining access because of their familiarity with the security \nprocedures. \n \nTo overcome the shortcomings of the manual operation, BCAS proposes \nto provide personnel with a Secure Contactless Card for access which allows for \nBiometric template to be stored in the Card for multi-factor authentication which \nshall be a part of a simple but completely automated system for authentication \nand access. The Contactless Card shall be fool-proof and almost impossible to \nreplicate, creating a mechanism for monitoring/control of the movements of \npersonnel and vehicles into the airports. \n \nThe doors and access points will be released only to authorized personnel \nafter they have been identified by the system. Each entry/exit will be logged \ncentrally for future reference. The system shall also be able to generate any level \nof information required on the persons available in the building at any given point \nof time. The system shall provide comprehensive historical data of all personnel \nwho have visited the building. The solution will have minimal manual operation \nfor overall success. \nContd..2..",
