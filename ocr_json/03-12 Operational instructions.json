Through this letter, |\nwould like to highlight a few points by which it should be our endeavour\nto increase our professional skills in airport security. The very presence\nof CISF personnel at the airports should instill a sense of security at the\nairports and scare away the mischief mongers/touts. | have also found\nthat there is lack of communication between different ranks of CISF\npersonnel at the airports as a result of which some gaps and faults creep\nin the security arrangements.\n\nThere are some instructions which need to be implemented in\nletter and spirit for which the DIGs/CASOs/DCs/ACs have to exert\nthemselves so that the ASGs can be really seen as skilled group of\nprofessionals managing Airport Security:-\n\n4. There is a need to increase the internal communication\nbetween CASOs and his officers and men. The\nDCs/ACslInspectors should be made incharge of operational,\nadministrative and regimental duties of the unit and constant and\ncontinuing briefing and debriefing need to be done to maximize\nefficient work output. It would also motivate our ASG personnel to\nobserve and improve during their operational duties. The\nsupervisory officers could also have a direct knowledge about the\noperational hurdles for their personnel and could bring these to the\nnotice of AAI and other superior functionaries.\n\n2. There is a need to effectively run the Control Rooms/C.C.T.V\nControl Rooms at the airports which should function as a live wire\nwith personnel properly handpicked by the CASOs who have\nentire geographical and operational knowledge of the airport. In\nevent of any emergency, the Control Room on viewing the CCTV\nlive coverage should be able to act and get the armed units of the\nairport into action-mode. These officials picked up to man the\nControl Rooms should be put under the supervision of\nDCs/ACs/Inspectors in the different airports depending on the size\n",
