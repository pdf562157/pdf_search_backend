ASGs are therefore\nsupposed to be in a very hlgh degree of preparedness to effectively respond to any\ncontingency which might adversely affect aviation security.\n2. \nTo take care of such contingencies, various contingency plans have been prepared\nfor all the airports for sequence of actions, coordination amongst various security\ncomponents and to avoid confusions on the role & responsibilities of different agencies\nduring the time of emergent situations. However, even the best laid security\nplans/systems have gray areas or weaknesses. These are either inherent or developed\nover the course of time due to complacency on the part of security personnel or some\nnew modus operandi adopted by the terrorists. Therefore, these contingency plans/mock\ndrills on various scenarios should be carried out regularly at all the airports to check the\nresponse time, to identify the grey areas and to fine tune the efficienry of the personnel\nto meet any sudden eventuality.\n3. \nTo maintain maximum operational preparedness, it has been felt essential to carry\nout an \"counter Terrorist Preparedness drive\" at all the airports for a period of 15\ndays from 01* to 15th August, 2O22. fhe following will be the key features of this\ndrive whlch will be observed by all the ASGs under cISF security cover during this\nperiod:-",
  "2": "A). MOCK DRILLS/OPERATIONAL DRILLS\nOperational Drills on various contingencies should be conducted by all the\nASGS. Some of the indicative operational drill scenarios are enclosed herewith\nas per Appendix-\"A\". The selection of scenarios may be decided by CASOs,\nrelevant to the topography of the airport.\nAirport Sector vide letter No. (7913) dated 30.07.2009 (copy enclosed as\nAppendaxsB\") had circulated a detailed Standing Operating procedure in\nthe event of a terrorist attack at an airport. The objective of the SOp was to\neffectively counter the terrorist attack on various contingencies. The\nsequence of action & coordination amongst various security components\n(Armed and Unarmed) has also been mentioned in the SOp. It has been\nobserved that during such exerclses, only the localized components of ASG\nare activated while the other ASG components even do not have knowledge\nof the contingency/drill. The security of all the airpoft cannot be ensured\nunless all the security components of ASG (Armed and Unarmed) respond in\na given contingency collectively in a coordinated manner. During the drive\nperiod, the five scenarios as mentioned in the SOP should be rehearsed to\nasceftain the response of all the ASG personnel (armed and unarmed\ncomponent) & coordinated action by all the layers. As far as possible, efforts\nshould be made to include maximum components of ASG in the drill\nirrespective of their area of deployment without affecting the normal\nfunctions of the airport.\nOperational surprise drills on different contingencies as mentioned in the\nCounter Terrorism Contlngency Plan as circulated by MHA may also be\nconducted during that period by all the ASGs.\nlYulti agency mock drills are in any case conducted as per their schedule.\nHowever, this is for internal capacity assessment.\nVideo clips of the past incidents of terror attack at world-wide airports should be\nshown to the Aviation Security Group personnel especially to the eRTs by\ndownloading such videos/films from the internet (You Tube etc.) to make them\naware about the modus operandi of terror elements and improve their field\ntactics. CASOS may also assess the modus operandi adopted in the past aviation\nincidents at world-wide airports and devise/conduct mock drills accordingly.\nDespite random check, most passengers enters the check-in area unscreened\nleaving obvious possible situation such as explosive bag being left unattended\netc. In such a scenario, lt is impoftant to analyze and assess the response &\nco-ordination of ASG surveillance staff, terminal marshals, QRTS, BDDS and\npersonnel deployed in the SHA for neutrallzation of threat. In this regard,\nexercises may be conducted during this period at all the airports and\nii)\niii)\niv)\nv)\nvi)",

This will allow to check the operational preparedness/ readiness of\nall the field formations in case of any unforeseen contingency, which may\noccur at any location and at any point of time. A code of this exercise may be\ndecided by the CASOs which will be ftashed to Unit line and off duty family\nmembers. If the exercise is launched in \"A,, shift, barrack and family\npersonnel of \"B\" shift personnel shall be mobilised. The other shifts shall not\nbe disturbed for operational reasons. Simultaneously, this exercise should be\nconducted in different shifts, so that the operational preparedness/ readiness\nof the all field formations in all shifts can be checked. During such drills the\nstrength/weakness in the process of response mechanism to react to any\ncontingency should be assessed and improved for future preparedness.\nOne evacuation mock drlll may also be conducted by the ASG using plain\nclothed unit personnel/airline security personnel/airport security personnel\nduring lean hours. The unarmed ASG personnel on duty shall perform this\nfunction immediately on receipt of information about an attack. All duty\npersonnel must be aware about the safe areas and their role in evacuating\nthe passenger during an attack.\nix) The cASos may arso refresh the identification procedures of the ASG\npersonnel like ribbons or other methods for eRT and suitably brief the ASG\npersonnel to negate the chances of foul play. This will also help on duty\npersonnel to identify the QRT personnel easily at the access control points or\nat any other duty posts to prevent any unauthorized entry in uniform posing\nas QRT personnel.\nx) QRTS in any case are being tested and activated many times.\nHowever, thier activation shall be in sync with other organs, armed\nas well as unarmed, and the same needs to be fine-tuned.\nB). OBSERVERS:\ni) The cASo should personally observe surprise mobilization drills as well as\ncounter terrorism operational drills - at least two each during the drive.\nii) The other exercises should be observed critically by the Gazetted officers of\nthe Unit.\niii) During the exercise, some officers/Sos should also be detailed as observers at\ndifferent locations to assess the performance of the pafticipating personnel at\nvarious points at the airport (city-side, terminal building, SHA and Apron) to\nhave a neutral and unbiased assessment on the response and peformance of\nvii)\nviii)",

He may have to organize checking at the Nakas,\nor order closure of Nakas for sometime. He will be the\nmain link for the communication of operational information\nto the various layers of ASG personnel formed above.\nDepending upon the facility available at the airport and as\npractised in the rehearsals/mock drills, operational\ninformation may be passed to Nakas, layers on RT sets,\nPBAXtelephone/public address system etc., for which\narrangement has to be made by the CASO and drills have\nto be rehearsed.\n(vii) Next step of the control room incharge is to inform the\nCASO (if he is not already informed), Dishict Police Control\nRoom, APS HQ officers and the FHQ control room.\nIt is very important that the control room functions with\nutmost efficiency in such situations. The control room should be\nable to communicate with each and every duty point /layer and\nofficers engaged in the operation\niI\n13\nI",
  "24": "i\nI\ni\n(b) Maintenance of Time Loq\nOne person in the control room under the directions of the\nln-charge Control Room should maintain 'time log' of various\nhappenings in the course of the contingency, including\ninformation such as 'when & how the first information about\nattack was received, when senior officers were informed, when\nthe line was informed about the reserves, when district police\ncontrol room officers informed, the time of arrival of the police,\nSr. CISF officials and specialized agencies (like the NSG) on the\nspot etc. All these relevant information should be serially and\nsequentially noted down in the form a log. This information\nbecomes important for the post-incidence analysis.\nIt is expected that the CASOs who have already been informed\nin the zonal conference about the above concept will rehearse the\nsame as many times as they can and till each of the personnel of the\nunit has a clear understanding about his/her response in the event of\nvarious contingencies. The concept mentioned above, will, needless,\nhave be adjusted to the physical features of every airport and its\neffectiveness will depend as to how efficiently every ASG personnel\nposted at the airport is deployed in tackling a terrorist attack. lf\nproperly rehearsed and practised ,even a srnall ASG will be able to\ngive a very effective response to a terrorist strike.\nt4\nCONCLUSION",
  "25": "F\nl\nCASOs will immediately make 'different layers of defence' for\ntheir respective airports following the guidelines given above and fine\ntune/finalise the same after analyzing the rehearsals/mock drills. After\neach mock drill, the CASO may have to adjust one element of layer\ninto another if local needs so require. Thereafter, I would expect\nevery ASG to send me the composition of its 'layers of defence' and\nthe type and numbers of arms available in each layer, the number\nand ranks of personnel who will be available in the Control Room and\nthe number of rehearsals which have been carried out on the above\nconcept by 20.08.2009 positively.\n15\n}\ni\nIi\nh",
