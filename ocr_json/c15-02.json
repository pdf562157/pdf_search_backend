  "4": "1.1 \nA set of uninsulated tinned copper wire of size 25 SWG, 30, 35, 38, 40 \nand 42 SWG are placed on a Perspex sheet.  The wires are laid out in S \nshaped curves.  The wires are placed behind varying thickness of \naluminum.  The requirement is to display 38 SWG wire not covered by \nstep wedge.  A tick will indicate the visibility of appropriate wire. Metallic \nmarker should be provided using high density material, so that SWG \nnumbers in the VDU are clearly visible.   \n \n2. \nUSEFUL PENETRATION (TEST NO. 2) \n \n2.1 \nDefines what level of details can be seen behind a thickness of known \nmaterial.  The requirement for this test is that the 24 SWG wire is seen \nunder second step wedge (5/16\u201d). (Note: This is equivalent to FAA, USA \nand DOT UK requirement).  Tick on log sheet will indicate what wires are \nvisible. \n \n3. \nMULTI ENERGY X-RAY (TEST No.3) \n \n3.1 \nWith multi energy X-Ray it should be possible to distinguish between \nmaterials of different average atomic number.  The use of sugar and salt \nsamples encapsulated on the test piece and various materials used in the \nconstruction of CTP will check the material discrimination facility.  A tick \nwill indicate that the sugar / salt samples are shown in different colour. \n \n4. \nSIMPLE PENETRATION (TEST No.4) \n \n4.1. \nThis test defines what thickness of steel the machine should be able to \npenetrate.  The steel step wedge on the CTP has steps of 2 mm from 16 \nmm to 30 mm with a lead strip to check that the machine is above or \nbelow the requirement.   The requirement is that lead is visible beneath 24 \nmm steel.  A tick in log sheet will indicate where a difference between the \nlead strip and the step wedge is visible. \n \n5. \nSPATIAL RESOLUTION (TEST No. 5) \n \n5.1 \nThis test defines the ability of the system to distinguish and display \nobjects, which are close together.  The CTP has 16 copper gratings at \nright angles to each other.  The requirement is that a vertical horizontal \ngrating can be seen.  A tick in the log sheet will indicate that gaps in the \ngratings are visible. \n \n6. \nMETHOD: \n \n6.1. \nThe CTP is to be used as a quick routine test carried out daily to \nensure that equipment is working properly and satisfactory image is \nobtained.  The results of the tests should be recorded.",
  "5": "6.2. \nThe CTP should be placed on the belt and passed through the belt \nat least once in a day before the baggage is screened or after the \nX-Ray equipment is switched on to ensure that the equipment is \nworking properly.  If the image is satisfactory the equipment may be \nused. \n \n6.3. \nThe CTP may be viewed by using image enhancing facility till the \noperator is satisfied that the machine is working properly.  The \noptimum position of CTP on the belt will depend on X-Ray source \nand detector arrangements.  This may be ascertained from the \nservice engineer, if need arises.  \n \n7. \nRESULTS: \n \n7.1 \nThe best results taking both colour and Black & While images into \naccount may be recorded for a particular machine. \n \n7.2 \nThe results of test should be recorded giving information like date, \ntime, machine number and type, supervisors name and other \nremarks. \n \n7.3 \nSupervisory officer should carry out the tests once in a week and \ncompare the results with daily test sheets.  In case the images are \nnot up to the standard, service engineer must be asked to rectify \nthe fault.  The machine may not be used when its performance is in \ndoubt or not satisfactory in the opinion of the supervisor. \n \n7.4 \nThe record mast be kept by the operator for one year after final \nentry.  The records may be checked by the inspecting officers of \nBCAS during airport inspection and report be submitted to \nCommissioner of Security (CA).  \n \n \n \n \nANNEXURE - II \n \nTHREAT IMAGE PROJECTION  (TIP) \n \n1. \nTIP software facility shall be incorporated in the offered X-ray machines to \nassist supervisors in testing the operator alertness and training X-ray \nscreeners to improve their ability in identifying specific threat object.   The \nsystem will create a threat object and the same will be superimposed on \nmonitor screen while a bag is being screened.  To acknowledge that the \noperator has seen the false object, operator must press the control panel",
  "6": "key that will cause the computer generated threat object to disappear from \nx-rayed bag image on the VDU screen.  Each operator\u2019s action shall be \nrecorded in the hard disc of the computer for the auditing purpose by the \nsupervisor or other authorized person. \n \n2 \nDesign of the system \n \n2.1. \nTIP software should be compatible with other X-ray technologies such as \nautomatic reject unit, Dual X-ray screen technologies, automatic threat \nrecognition system etc.   All X-ray image functions must be available at \nthe same time along with the TIP. \n \n2.2.   Image library \n \n2.2.1. The TIP facility should have an image library containing at least 100 \nexplosive devices, 100 knives and 100 firearms in various sizes, shapes, \nlocations & orientations. However, the system shall have facility to expand \nthe library to incorporate additional images by user without assistance of \nthe manufacturer. \n \n2.2.2 The image library should contain images of threats at different orientations   \n-both plane and end-on orientation should be used.  Although these will \nbe assigned different file names and references, it must be possible to \ncross-reference these as the same threat.  All threat Image Projection \nimages must be realistic, representative and non distinguishable form real \nthreat items.  \n \n2.3. \nTime Interval \n \n \nProgramming facility shall be available to project threat images in different \nintervals.  The time period for threat image as well as image mix in \npercentage shall be user programmable e.g. software shall select 40 % \nimages of explosive devices, 35 % of fire arms & 25 % of knives or \nRandom etc. \n \n2.3.1. Once the screener has responded to identity the computer generated \nthreat image, it should remain on the screen for a predefined user \nprogrammable time for analysis.  The image should be highlighted, upon \nidentification, and feedback message shall be visible to the screener. \n \n2.4. \nSYSTEM ADMINISTRATION \n \n2.4.1. The threat image projection facility shall have details of user data-base \nsuch as airport name, screener name, organization, user ID number, level \nof access such as screener, Administrator, Maintenance & password etc.",
  "7": "2.4.2. Access to start up menu should be restricted only to the authorized \nindividuals.  A log - in procedure by means of \u201cPassword\u201d or \u201cSecurity \nKey\u201d, could achieve restricted access to each of the comment.  The log - \nin procedure should not take longer than 20 seconds.  The system should \nhave facility to by pass the TIP facility, if programmed so by the system \nadministrator.  It is to be ensured that the TIP software shall not be \nhindrance to normal functioning of X-ray Machines. \n \n2.4.3 When the operator logs - in or logs - out, message should be displayed on \nX-Ray BIS VDU Screen to confirm that he/she has been correctly logged - \nin or logged  - out. \n \n2.5 \nFeed Back Report \n \n2.5.1 The threat image Projection should be capable of giving feedback \u201cHIT, \nMISS or FALSE ALARM\u201d message.  No message will be presented if a \nscreener correctly passed as clear bag. \n \n2.5.2 A\u201dHIT\u201d message to be presented when a screener has correctly identified \na Threat Image Projection image.  A \u201cMISS\u201d message shall be presented \nwhen screener fails to identify the TIP image.  A \u201cFalse Alarm\u201d message \nshall be given when screener incorrectly indicate TIP image when in fact \nno threat image projection is present. The feedback should clearly \nindicate in a screen that a TIP object has been correctly identified / a TIP \nobject has been missed / or no TIP object was present. The information \nshould be recorded in the database. \n \n2.5.3. Different colour coding shall be used for feedback to the Screener.  It is \nrecommended that colour code \u201cRed for MISS\u201d, Green for \u201cHIT\u201d and \nYellow to False Alarm or interrupt\u201d be used. \n \n2.5.4.
