In\ncase the SHA has only one X-ray machine, then, the ladies\nbooth should be shifted right next to it.\n\n(ji) | The screening arrangement of the ladies booth should be\nsuch that the lady pax can conveniently keep an eye on her\npersonal baggage as it passes through the X-ray BIS. The\nscreen should come upto her shoulder height for this purpose.\n\n2. At many places, ladies frisking booth were designed long time back\nnot taking into account this requirement. Elaborate structures of wood\netc, have been made which completely shield the lady pax with the result\nthat for few minutes she cannot have an eye contact with her personal\nbaggage.\n\n3. Of late, some complaints have been received from the lady pax\nregarding missing of expensive items/cash from their personal hand\nbaggage while it is in the process of being passed through the X-ray\nmachine. CISF personnel have, so far, shown extremely good record in\nintegrity. Therefore, immediate steps need to be taken as suggested\nabove so that there is no occasion for any lady passenger to make such an\nallegation. |! would expect the CASOs to take up this matter with their\n",
