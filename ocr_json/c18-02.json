The  report  of   the  committee  has been examined  and  the   following   \ndirections    on the  above   subject  are  issued   to  ensure  protection  of  \nperimeter    at   all  civil  airports  in the  India  so  as to  prevent   intrusion /  \nunauthorized  access  through  the  perimeter:- \n \nPerimeter  lighting  \n \n(i) \nPerimeter  lighting  shall be  provided  in  the  inner side  \nof the  airport  alongwith  the  perimeter  road and  light    \nshall be    focusing  towards   fencing  / wall; \n \n(ii) \nPerimeter  lighting   shall be   of   average 3-5 Lux. \n \n(iii) \nPoles  for lighting  the perimeter   shall be   installed  at \nsuitable  locations  so as   to illuminate   perimeter  wall  \nincluding  perimeter  road.  The  average  lux  level  \nbetween 3.5  lux  shall   be   calculated  for the  area  \nbetween  perimeter  wall and width  of perimeter  road.   \nAccordingly, height   of the  ,  distance  between    the \npoles   and   wattage  of lamp  shall   be worked  out to \nachieve  average  lux  requirement   of  3.5. \n \n(iv) \n \n \n:2",
