This Is necessary to ensure devices are not introduced into the aircraft once it has been cleared\nControl of access must then be maintained unt the aircraft doors are closed prior to push back.\n\nti Searchers should be briefed not to touch suspicious objects but to notify the search coordinator,\nmark the location with a-prominent object (but not touching the device) and withdraw from the immediate\narea to await further instructions. When a suspect device is discovered the possibility of secondary devices\nshould not be discounted,\n\n8 Hand-held communications are useful for coordination of the search and are often the only way\nof ensuring appropriate and speedy lifesaving procedures for search and evacuation, However, once a\nsha cat Cevice has been located those using hand-held communications should immediately move away\nand ensure that they and anyone else in'the atea move outside the cordon as quickly as possible.
