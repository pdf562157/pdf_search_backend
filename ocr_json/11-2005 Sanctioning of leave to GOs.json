No relief can be provided which might be necessary in some cases,\nparticularly for the APSUs where GOs are sometimes performing shift\nduties.\n\n2. In emergencies, it is extremely embarrassing to find that that the\nCommandant of the unit is not in station and the fact is not known to\nthe IG.\n\n3. Sometimes, additional charge in such cases is held by the\nCommandant of another unit without the knowledge of IG.\n\nTherefore, in these matters, a practice has to be adopted which takes\ncare of above mentioned problems. It has, therefore, been decided that:-\n\n41. No Commandant/incharge of a unit will sanction Earned Leave to his\nsubordinate gazetted officer without prior approval of the DIG and a\ndecision on the point whether a relief is required, and if so, who and\nfrom where it will come.\n\n2. The DisG will also sanction leave or . : long absence (tour/training)of the\nCommandant, after prior clearance from IG and after deciding about the\n\narrangement for the relief. i\n\nThis should be strictly complied with in future. }\ndle\n(M.S.
