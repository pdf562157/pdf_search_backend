Aircraft operators, pilots, flight attendants, airport visitors,\nand passengers on aircraft will be subject to these rules.\n\nIL. Its important to note that the enforcement procedures may be applied to any individuals,\nnot just employees of aviation businesses. For example, any person who is suspeoted of\ninterfering with, threatening or intimidating a screening person in the performance of their\nscreening duties, may be penalized.\n\nIL. Provision of the following Acts and rules shall be applicable for enforcement action: -\n\n(@) The Aircraft Act, 1934\n\n(b) The Tokyo Convention Act, 1975\n\n(\u00a9) The Anti-Hijacking Act, 2016.\n\n(G) The Suppression of Unlawful Act against Safety of Civil Aviation Acts, 1982 amended\nin 1994,\n\nPage 91 of 106\n",

GOT has issued regulations protecting the information it considers important in performing\nits security function. Information that may be kept secret and will be known as Sensitive\nSecurity Information. BCAS will monitor and take appropriate action in order to protect the\nsafety or security of the travelling public. Scope of sensitive security information will\ninclude information developed for the conduct of security as well as research and develop\nactivities.\n\nV. The BCAS is empowered to announce the enforcement procedures in the form of SOP or\nAVSEC Order consistent with the broad authority granted by the Aircraft Act, 1934, the\n\u2018Aircraft Rules, 1937 and The Aircraft (Security) Rules, 2011 as amended from time to\ntime.\n\nVI The Director General, BCAS shall enumerate the different levels of enforcement for\nvarying circumstances and for the nature and level of non-compliance. The various\nenforcement measures shall be implemented in accordance with the Aircraft Act, 1934, The\n\u2018Aircraft Rules, 1937, the Aircraft (Security) Rules 2011 and directions issued by the\nDirector General, BCAS under Section SA of the Aircraft Act, 1934, punishable under\nsection 11A of the same Act.\n\n9.4 \u2014 Investigation\nThe investigation process is triggered by a notification (report) submitted in accordance with the\nestablished security occurrence reporting arrangements. Several basic phases of an investigation\ncan be distinguished.\nBesides the specified quality control oversight,\n(@ the Director General, BCAS may order investigation of any security accident or\nsecurity incident and appoint an officer not below the rank of Assistant Director,\nBCAS as Inquiry Officer.\n() the Inquiry Officer shall, after affording an opportunity of being heard to the defaulting\nperson, make a report to the Director General who should forward the same to the\nCentral Government, in accordance with Rule 46 of the Aircraft (Security) Rules 2011.\n9.4.1 - Steps to an investigation\n\u2018The steps of investigation relating to AVSEC Audit are given as under:\nLSet up of the investigation team: with the required skills and expertise. The size of the\n\nteam and expert profile of its members depend on the nature and severity of the occurrence\n\nPage 92 of 106\n",
  "43": "SECRET\n\nGovernment of India\n(Ministry of Civil Aviation)\nBUREAU OF CIVIL AVIATION SECURITY\nNational Civil Aviation Security Quality Control Programme - 2018\n\nbeing investigated. The investigating team may require the assistance of other specialists.\nOften, a single person is assigned to carry out internal (to the concerned organisation)\ninvestigation of an incident considered to have limited potential to cause harm.\n\nI Gathering of factual information: that is pertinent to the understanding of the\ncircumstances and the events leading to the occurrence. A variety of information sources\nwill be used to collect the necessary data for the reconstruction of the event. To ensure the\ncontinued availability of such data for the purpose of aviation security improvement,\ninformation sources need to be protected.\n\nIll. Event reconstruction: In order to establish the exact sequence of events leading to the\nsecurity occurrence with its causal and contributory factors, the output of the reconstruction\nphase should be a set of events that agrees with recorded information and which unifies the\nviews of the various persons who were involved in these events immediately before and\nafter the occurrence.\n\nIV. Analysis of the information: To assess the risk and provide explanation of the technical\nand operational factors, and underlying (including organisational) factors and issues, the\nanalysis shall provide argumentation about why the occurrence happened and enable the\ndrawing of conclusions and identification of security actions to eliminate or mitigate the\nrisk.\n\nV. Conelusion: Drawing conclusions on the basis of collected and analysed information,\ngenerally presented by the following categories:\n\n(a) Main (direct) cause(s) and contributing factors leading to the occurrence;\n\n(b) Findings that identify additional hazards which have risk potential but have not\nplayed direct role in the occurrence;\n\n(\u00a9) Other findings that have potential to improve the security of operations or to resolve\nambiguity or controversy issues contributed to the circumstances surrounding the\noccurrence.\n\nVI. _ Identifying the lessons to be learned from a security occurrence requires an understanding\nof not just what happened, but why it happened. Therefore, the investigation should look\nbeyond the obvious causes and aim to identify all the contributory factors, some of which\nmay be related to weaknesses in the system\u2019 s defence or other organisational issues.\n\nVII. Identification of security recommendations and actions to be taken in order to eliminate or\nmitigate the security deficiencies identified by the investigation. The security\nrecommendations are the main product of any occurrence investigation and are made in the\nfinal report.\n\nVIII. Communication of security messages to those who have the authority to implement the\nsecurity recommendations and to the aviation community in general by means of security\ninformation exchange and lesson dissemination. For maximum effectiveness, the outcome\nof the investigation should focus on determining hazards and risks rather than identifying\nindividuals to blame and punish. The way the investigation is conducted influences the\noverall security culture in the aviation service provider organisation. According to Council\nDirective 94/56/EC the investigation\u201d shall in no case be concerned with appointing blame\n\nPage 93 of 106\n\n",
