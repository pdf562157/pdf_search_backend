The Counter Terrorist Contingency Plan (CTCP) is\ncomprehensive and addresses emergent situations, which can arise on the city side\ncovering perimeter area, terminal buildings, vital installations, and operational area of\nairport. The plan inter-alia envisages different scenarios of terrorist threats and law\nand order challenges. It delineates operational measures to thwart the same as well as\nthe principles / methodology of response and coordination. It demarcates the\nresponsibilities amongst the forces deployed at airports.\n2. \nObiective:\nThe objective of this CTCP is to lay down clear guiclelines and responsibilities for\nall stakeholders at an airport, who are responsible for handling and controlling the\nemergent situations at the airport. It will be subject to control of the Aerodrome/Airport\ncommlttee and lts superior commrttees such as central committee (cc) and committee\nof Secretaries on Aircraft Hijack as envisaged under MoCA/BeAS's'-eontingency plan for\nhandling aircraft hijack situation\" of 2011.\n3. \nTerror situations anticioated :\nThe contingency plan for unlawful interference by terrorists with civil aviation,\nmay involve violent or silent entry (as passengers) of terrorists.\nI. In Silent entry, terrorists enter the airpoft as passengers to board an\naeroplane, to hijack it to raise their demand in exchange for the safety of\npassengers. For it, precautionary measures have to be taken through physical\nchecks, various machines, dog squads etc., to prevent any passenger to enter an\nairoaft/airport with arms, explosives etc. However, if an aeroplane is hijacked,\nthen action as laid down in the \"Contingency Plan for handling aircraft hijack\nsituation\" issued by BCAS in 2011, should be taken. It will involve demand by\nterrorists, response of the Government, negotiations, interpreters etc, which will\ntake 1-3 days or more. Similar action will be taken in case of a hostage situation\nin any part of the airport leading to some demand by the terrorists.\nII. In Violent attack on airport, the main objective of terrorists is to inflict\nmaximum damage and casualties. As such, the forces have to respond\nimmediately to kill them to minimize the damage/casualties. As such, the\nsecurity forces have to be well prepared for it in advance. For it, this CTCp has\nPaBe 1of 24",

  "28": "SECRET\n- \nSOP ON COUNTER TERRORIST CONTINGENCY PLAN (CTCP)\n,\n1. \nIntroduction\nAirports are on the threat radar of terrorist groups as high-value and high-impact\ntargets. In view of prevailing security scenario and threats from various cross border\nand home grown terror groups, a counter terrorist plan has been drawn up to tackle\ndifferent types of threats. The Counter Terrorist Contingenry Plan (CTCP) is\ncomprehensive and addresses emergent situations, which can arise on the city side\ncovering perimeter area, terminal buildings, vital installations, and operational area of\nairport. The plan inter-alia envisages different scenarios of terrorist threats and law\nand order challenges. It delineates operational measures to thwart the same as well as\nthe principles / methodology of response and coordination. It demarcates the\nresponsibilities amongst the forces deployed at airports.\n2. \nObiective:\nThe objective of this CTCP is to lay down clear guidelines and responsibilities for\nall stakeholders at an airpoft, who are responsible for handling and controlling the\nemergent situations at the airport. It will be subject to control of the Aerodrome/Airport\nCommittee and its superior Committees such as Central Committee (CC) and Committee\nof Secretaries on Aircraft Hijack as envisaged under MoCA/BCAS's \"Contingenry plan for\nhandling aircraft hijack situation\" of 2011.\n3. \nTerror situations anticioated :\nThe contingency plan for unlawful interference by terrorists with civil aviation,\nmay involve violent or silent entry (as passengers) of terrorists.\nI. In Silent entrv, terrorists enter the airport as passengers to board an\naeroplane, to hijack it to raise their demand in exchange for the safety of\npassengers. For it, precautionary measures have to be taken through physical\nchecks, various machines, dog squads etc. to prevent any passenger to enter an\naircraft/airport with arms, explosives etc. However, if an aeroplane is hijacked,\nthen action as laid down in the \"contingency plan for handling aircraft hijack\nsituation\" issued by BCAS in 2011, should be taken. It will involve demand by\nterrorists, response of the Government, negotiations, interpreters etc, which will\ntake 1-3 days or more. similar action will be taken in case of a hostage situation\nin any part of the airport leading to some demand by the terrorists.\nII. rn violent attack on airport, the main objective of terrorists is to inflict\nmaximum damage and casualties. As such, the forces have to respond\nimmediately to kill them to minimize the damage/casualties. As such, the\nsecurity forces have to be well prepared for it in advance. For it, this CTCp has\nPage 1of 24",
