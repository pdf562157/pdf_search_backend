  "1": "CIRCULAR 42/2000 \n \n \nSUB : SCREENING OF KNIFE IN X-RA BIS \n \n \nA few instances have been brought to our notice wherein knife hidden in between \npineapple could not be identified or detected during x-ray screening in the hand baggage by \nthe APS Staff.  Subsequently a team of BCAS officers conducted `test\u2019 on the x-ray machines \ninstalled at BCAS Hqrs.  training center and also at IGI Airport, new Delhi to verify the \ncapability of the x-ray system installed at the airports.  In this exercise a knife of \napproximately 8 inches in length (5\u201d blade and 3\u201d handle) was placed between two \npineapples and placed in the bag, which contained other normal house, hold articles as well.  \nWhen the baggage was passed through x-ray machine as above the knife could be detected.  \nHowever, on certain occasions, the image of the knife was shielded by dense orange colour of \nthe pineapple.  With the facility of image processing like inorganic / organic stripping, high \npenetration black & white imaging etc., the detection of knife was possible.  The position of \nthe knife in the bag and orientation of the bag itself on the conveyor belt do play a critical \nrole and the alertness and efficiency of the x-ray operator determine the success rate of the \ndetection. \n \n \nIt is therefore, desired that all security personnel of APSU / Airlines who are to \nperform x-ray screening duty should be got trained in x-ray screening by this Bureau either at \nthe BCAS Hqrs.  Training Centre or at other locations whenever we organize the training.  \nDue importance may please be given to this aspect.  It may also be ensured that only trained \npersonnel are deployed for x-ray screening duty and such personnel are not withdrawn form \nairports at least for three years. \n (R.K.Singh) \nAddl.
