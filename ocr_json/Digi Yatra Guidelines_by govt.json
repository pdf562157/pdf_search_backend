  "6": "Digi Yatra Biometric Boarding System DY-BBS \n \n \n6 \nPREFACE \nThe Ministry of Civil Aviation (MoCA) of Government of India is responsible for formulation \nof national policies and programmes for the development and regulation of the Civil \nAviation sector in the country. It is responsible for the administration of the Aircraft Act, \n1934, Aircraft Rules, 1937 and various other legislations pertaining to the aviation sector \nin the country. The Indian civil aviation industry has emerged as one of the fastest growing \nindustries in the country during the last three years. India is currently considered the third \nlargest domestic civil aviation market in the world and is expected to become the world\u2019s \nlargest domestic civil aviation market in the next 10 to 15 years.  \n \nThe Civil Aviation industry has therefore ushered in a new era of expansion, driven by \nfactors such as low-cost carriers (LCCs), modern airports, Foreign Direct Investment \n(FDI) in domestic airlines, advanced information technology (IT) interventions and \ngrowing emphasis on regional connectivity.  \n \nConsidering the growth projections, its direct impact on the Passenger journey, the cost \nof Infrastructure and the impact on the speed and efficiency of Passenger processes, The \nMinistry of Civil Aviation has taken up a key initiative to reimagine air travel in India looking \nbeyond the conventional \u201cbuild a bigger Airport to manage more Passengers\u201d to look for \nInnovation and technology for better and cost effective solutions. One of the key initiatives \nin this direction is \u201cThe Digi Yatra\u201d which intends to give a seamless, contact-less, hassle-\nfree and paperless journey experience to every air traveller in India. Using cutting edge \nIdentity Management and \u201cFace recognition\u201d technologies, it aims to simplify the \nPassenger processes at various check points in the Airport right from the terminal entry \ngate, check-in/ bag drop, security check and boarding gates. \n \nThe MoCA, has constituted a Technical Working Committee (TWC) consisting of Subject \nMatter Experts (SME) from a few of the major airports in India and AAI. The TWC under \nthe Digital Cell of Digi Yatra has been working for the past year on the Digi Yatra Project \nand have done trials at some of the leading airports in India to find out the best possible \nsolution that can be implemented by all the airports in India. After several workshops and \ndeliberations with aviation stakeholders and regulators, the Digi Yatra Process was \ndocumented by the TWC and submitted to MoCA for circulating as a National Policy. \n \nSubsequent to the release of the policy and the issue of the CAR by the MoCA, there \nhave been further deliberations held to make the enrolment process more user friendly \nand empowering passengers themselves to create the Digi Yatra ID credential. \nPassengers will also be able to directly share the Digi yatra-ID travel credential data to \nrelevant stakeholders like Airlines, OTAs, Airports & other regulatory bodies.",
  "7": "Digi Yatra Biometric Boarding System DY-BBS \n \n \n7 \nWith the new Digi Yatra process, Passengers will no longer need to show their tickets/ \nboarding passes and their physical Identity cards at many of the check points at the \nAirport, since the ticket/ boarding Pass is integrated with the Identity document. This will \nlead to reduced queue waiting times, faster processing times, Contact-less and safer  and \nsimpler processes. \n \nDIGI YATRA VISION",

The JVC/ SPV shall obtain the AUA/ KUA license from UIDAI (If needed) or \nsubscribe to AADHAAR AUA/ KUA services from UIDAI\u2019s authorized agencies. \nc. The Common Digi Yatra ID ecosystem offers core passenger services viz. \nenrolment, authentication, consented profile sharing etc., and shall be built as a \nshared national infrastructure (henceforth referred as \u201cDigi Yatra Ecosystem\u201d) with \nAPIs, Mobile Apps, SDKs & Website for airports, airlines and other stakeholders \nto integrate. The salient features of the process are as below. \ni. \nThe primary service will be used at the airport terminal entry for the purpose \nof Identity Check using Digi Yatra ID Travel credentials with the single \ntoken of Face Biometrics.  \nii. \nPassengers would also have the ability to directly share their Digi Yatra ID \nTravel credentials to airports and other stakeholders \niii. \nFor passengers who do not opt for the Digi Yatra-ID registration, provision \nwill be made to enroll at the airport \niv. \nFor passengers who do not wish to use facial biometric, provision will be \nmade for automated travel document check (Using Barcode/ Mobile QR \ncode scan) on e-gates with an ability for CISF security to do a manual ID \nCard check and permit passengers to enter the Airport Terminal and cross \nother check points inside the airport \nv. \nAt all other check points across the airport Viz.

This \nfacial data cannot be stored by airports for longer than the duration of \ntransit of passenger and facial data will be purged out of the system 24 \nhours after take-off/ departure of the flight. \nix. \nAt the time of consent collection, Digi Yatra ecosystem/ App will strictly \ninform and take consent from the user for the sharing of face biometric data \nfor the airport checkpoints and optionally another consent to opt for any \nvalue added services that the passenger may wish to avail from the Digi \nYatra ecosystem partners. \nx. \nAirports may be permitted to create profile of users based on explicit \nconsent from the user for marketing/ sales/ promotional offers etc.  \ni.
