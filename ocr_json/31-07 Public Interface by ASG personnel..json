Delhi\nNo.0-4201 1/APC/OPS(2)/Clrcular/AS/07- /3940 Dated :/7Dec\u2019 2007\nCIRCULAR NO, AS-\"31/2007 :\n\n\u2018Sub: Public Interface by ASG personnel\n\nASG personnel from different states/regions of India are performing duties at\nthe airports. Each region has its distinct spoken language, peculiar expressions and.\ntone of speech. It Is quite possible that words, expressions and body language which\nmay have perfectly civil or normal connotation In the speaker's place/region may be\nperceived as rude or impertinent by persons from another area or region.\n\n02. In view of the fact that airport users generally have educated, sophisticated\n\n. and high socio-economic profile, it is felt that sometimes a particular expression\n\nused by a CISF person can be misread/misunderstood as rude and lacking\u2019 in\ndesired courtesy Therefore, a need is felt for use of standardized expressions of\nspeech which leave no scope for misinterpretation. Similarly, bady language should\nalso be consciously modified to rule out such misinterpretations.\n\n03. _ With a view to obtain feedback on standardized words and phrases to be used\nby ASG personnel while interacting with the passengers during the course of thelr\nduties, a committee was constituted at IG! Airport, which was represented by the\nASG staff of various ranks actually performing these duties, Based on the feedback\nteceived from the sald committee, the standardized language/words to be used by\nduty personnel at different places/posts while addressing the passengers/staff anc\nothers have been finalized and enclosed at Annex-I.\n\n04 There are several other points (not incorporated in the Annex) where CISF\npersonnel may need to interact with the paseengers/staff and other alrport users\nDuring conversations at these points also, suitable standardized language, at\nenumerated above may be evolved and should be used. CASOs have to personally\nassociate themselves with the task.\n\n08. Conversation with the passengers/staff and other airport users should br\nstrictly limited to professional requirements only. Personalized remark or talks shoul:\nbe strictly avoided at the duty points.\n",

In general, the following words/phrases and expressions should not he used J\n\u2018Tu\u2019 or \u2018Tum\u2019, \u2018Tera\u2019 \u2018arre\u2019, \u2018beta\u2019, \u2018uncle\u2019, \u2018chalo\u2019, \u2018Hato\u2019, \u2018Suno\u2019 etc,\n07. Merely using standardized phrases is not enough. The tone and tenor of\nspeech |s equally Important and should be emphasized. Sometimes aggressi\nbody language of the ASG staff, either consciously or inadvertently, may also bel\n\nmisinterpreted as aggressive/insolent during public Interface. The expressions ma\n\ngestures mentioned at Annex-ll should be strictly avolded by the ASG personnel\nwhile on duty.\n\n08. In fact, even mutual unprofessional conversations among ASG personnel a\nabove during duty hours In the presence of passengers at the alrpart may also invite:\ncriticism when overheard/observed by others and should thus, be avoided.\n\n08. In addition to the above, while making deployment at places of public ]\nInterface, utmost care should be taken to erisure the sultability of the Individual \u2018ed\nthe Job at the particular point and proper counseling of the Force personnel is\nrequired to be done about the local culture, customs and-trends.\n\n10. It should be kept In mind that Improper, rude or aggressive \u2018behavior In i\nspeech, expressions or body language may sometimes. be used by the passengers ]\nor others while interacting with on duty ASG staff, or more specifically expressing 4\ntheir annoyance towards us. Such situations are Indeed a test of one\u2019s patience and\nendurance and in fact may be a conscious attempt to provoke us. The-mark of\nprofessionalism of the ASG personne! would be to maintain composure and not be\nprovoked by such rude or aggressive behaviour. However, our response should be ]\n\nfirm, In a polite tone and delivered in a Impersonal manner befitting a disciplined ]\nForce Performing Its bounden duty.\n\n11. \u2018Strict compliance of above guidelines should be ensured by all CASOs. and\nthe. Unit supervisory officers should sensitize the ASG personnel themselves In\nspecially convened \u2018Sammelans\u2019 accordingly for compliance in letter and spirit as}\nalso thorough frequent briefings, on-the-job trainings etc. Senior officers, during their\nInteractions with unit personnel, should note this behavioral aspect and advise them\nsuitably. Such sessions should be held at least once @ month in every Unit and j\nthese Instructions passed on even at the cost of repetition.\n\n42.
