This exhibition creates \nwrong impression of the working.  The primary objective of checking of hand-baggage is to \nensure that it does not contain any explosive or weapon.  This checking should be done in \nextremely discreet manner and care should be taken to see that unnecessary opening of items \nis not resorted to.  The Airport Security personnel should be properly educated to search the \npersonal belongings of the passengers in a polite and discreet manner as far as possible and \nsecondly to equip them with clean gloves for handling the personal belongings of the lady \npassengers.  This would go a long way in easing the discomfort of passengers when their \npersonal belongings are searched and handled. \n \n (R.K.Singh) \nAddl. Commissioner of Security (CA) \n \nNO.CAS-7(1)/97-DIV-I \nDated : 30.11.2000"
