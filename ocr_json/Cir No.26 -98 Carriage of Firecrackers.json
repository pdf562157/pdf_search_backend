  "1": "CIRCULAR  26  /  1998 \n \nSUB: CARRIAGE OF FIRECRACKERS \n \n \nInstances have come to the notice of the Bureau wherein air passengers report to the \ncheck-in counters at the airports with check-in baggage containing firecrackers.  Firecrackers \ncontain explosives and carriage of explosives in check-in baggage is prohibited under Rule 8 \nof Aircraft Rules, 1937. \n \n2. \nAll air operators shall ensure that any attempt by passengers to smuggle explosives \nincluding fire crackers into the aircraft is not only foiled but the passengers involved in such \nacts are also handed over to the police and FIR is lodged against such passengers for \nappropriate action.  Mere confiscation of firecrackers detected in the check-in baggage and \nsubsequent letting off of such passengers are not enough.  Legal action against such \npassengers is essential to prevent unlawful interferences with civil aviation operations. \n \n3. \nAll traveling public may be suitably educated on the above lines by way of warning \nmentioned in the airlines ticket and by display of boards in terminal buildings.  Stringent \npunishment to offenders alone will act as deterrent against potential offenders. \n \n (J.P. VERMA) \nOFFICER ON SPECIAL DUTY (INT) \n \n(REF: NO.CAS-15 (6) / 98-DIV-I \nDated : 14.12.1998)"
