Dethi\n\nNo.0-4201 /APC/OPS (2)/Circular/AS/09 - 2 03 Dated 08 april\u2019 2009\nCIRCULAR NO. AS -24/ 2009\n\nub: INFRASTRUCTURE FOR CONTINGENCY RESPONSE AT AIRPORTS\n\nThe Govt of India has well-established guidelines regarding the infrastructure\nrequired to be in place to deal with hijack and other contingent situations at the\nairports. This includes a well equipped Aerodrome Committee Control Room and\nForward Command Post respectively which are required to be established at each\nairport.\n\n02. It is felt that despite the fact that it is primarily the responsibility of the\nrespective Airport Operators to ensure that AC Control Room and Forward\nCommand Post are adequately equipped and the equipment/communication\nfacilities etc are always in working order/operational, so that they can be made use\n\nof during any contingent situation, the ASGs must also monitor and ensure the\nsame.\n\n03. Recently, at IGi Airport, New Delhi, after a hijack message was received from\nthe pifot on 01.02.2009, the anti-hijacking mechanism was activated at all levels.\nDuring the incident handling, it was observed that the only effective means of\ncommunication on the ground was through cellular phones. This state of affairs is\nnot ideal as in the event of network failure, al! communication links would have been\nsnapped. Therefore, multiple means of communication, as envisaged in the Anti-\nHijacking Contingency Plan should be available with the ASG and other concerned\nagencies engaged in the operations.\n\n04. In view of the above, it is felt necessary that CASOs of ASGs must play @\nproactive role to ensure that Anti Hijacking /Contingency response apparatus at their\nrespective airports is available in a state of operational preparedness at all times.\nThis is essential since the ASGs, by virtue of being allotted a key role in tackling the\nHijack Situation are a major stake holder in this matter. The ASGs have to associate\nin.a proactive way with the airport management so that the communication systems\ndescribed in the Anti-Hijack Manual for this purpose are both put in place and kepi in\nvery good state of maintenance by the airport management.\n\n05. The following guidelines are being issued towards this end to ensure accurate\nfunctionality of AC Control Room and Forward Command Post:\n\n(i) | Amechanism is to be devised in coordination with the Airport Operator for\nchecking the status/working of all equipment (multiple means of\ncommunications like landline phones, hotlines, RT sets, intercom etc,\n",
  "2": "(ii)\n\n(iil\n\n(iv)\n\n(vi)\n\naudio-visual equipment and computers etc available in the Aerodrome\nCommittee Control Room and Forward Command Post respectively) on_a\nweekly basis. The ASG should ideally be involved in this process of\n\nchecking through a designated ASG official to be detailed by the\nconcerned CASO.\n\nA proper log with regard to functional status/deficiency in each equipment\nshould be maintained. Any deficiency observed should immediately be\nbrought to the notice of Airport Operator for rectification on top priority.\n\nThe CASO should personally check the condition and workability of all the\nequipment atleast once a month. Any chronic shortcoming or matfunction\nobserved should be immediately taken up with the APD/APC and also\nraised in the APSC meeting for necessary action.\n\nThe list of all Aerodrome Committee members and alternate members\nmust be readily available with each CASO. The list should contain the\nName, designation, phone numbers (off/res/mobile), Office/Res addresses\nof all the AC members and alternate members and kept in the personal\n\n\u201ccustody by CASO. As some of the key officials are likely to be changed/\n-transferred, the AC list must be up-dated as and when necessary or once\n\nevery month, A copy of the list, duly updated, should be sent to Airport\nSector HQ for record, so as to reach by 15.04.09. Subsequent changes in\nthe list, if any, should also be immediately conveyed to my office from time\nto time.\n\nWhenever any contingency of hijack threat arises at any airport. the\nrespective CASO by virtue of being the member of Aerodrome Committee\nhas to remain busy, but it should be ensured by the respective CASO that\nthe designated officers of ASG with adequate seniority (GOs in case of\nbigger airports and Inspectors or at least Sls for other airports per\navailability in station) should take charge of prominent\noperational/administrative functions at, (1) Forward Command Post (2)\nASG Control Room (3) Inner Cordon (4) General administration including\nmedia management and crowd control (5) Earmarked location for physical\nchecks of rescued passengers etc, in descending order of seniorily. All\nthese designated officers should be well versed with their respective roles\nfor assigned functions to achieve effective response to the Hijack situation\nIn the event of other contingencies also, the designated officers should\ntake charge of the operational functions in the same order as mentioned\nabove to contain the contingent situation.\n\nDisG/ Airports should try to be associated in conduct of Annual Anti\nHijacking Exercise at various airports under their respective jurisdiction\nThey may organize their tours/formal and informal inspections in such \u00ab\nfashion that they are present during the exercise.\n",
  "3": "(vi)\n\n(viii)\n\n3S\n\nIn the Delhi incident, it was also observed that the tail of the cordon laid\naround the affected aircraft (parked at the isolation bay) was obstructing\nnormal airport operations. This should not have been the case. The cordon\nshould be laid in such a manner that normal aircraft operations are not\naffected. Thus the limit and size of the cordon should be reviewed at the\n\nASG level to preclude the possibility of such obstruction in normal airport\noperations.\n\n{t is also felt necessary that each airport should have a designated\narea/space inside the terminal where the passengers of the affected flight,\nafter disembarking following any such incident, can be segregated for\nimmediate medical aid, counselling, preliminary interrogation by the focal\npolice and debriefing. The area should be secure, its access controlled and\nadequately segregated and have basic amenities like drinking water, tailet\nfacilities etc. All CASOs should earmark such an area/hall/room in\ncoordination with the Airport Director/Controller.\n\n\u2018The. above instructions are by way of general guidelines and the specifics\n\nhave. to:be suitably worked out by each CASO. They are meant to supplement the\nexisting instructions for handling hijack and other contingent situations.\n\nSi Urog\n(M. S. Bali)\nADG/Airport Sector\n\nDistribution:- 1 DisG Airports\n\n2.
