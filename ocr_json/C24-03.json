  "1": "CIRCULAR  NO.  24/  2003 \n \n \nIt has been brought to the notice of the Bureau that visitors are allowed \nbeyond the visitors area and at times they go upto Immigration area in departure \nterminal of the airport. The segregation point meant for restricting the entry of \nvisitors is manned at some airports by traffic wardens of AAI and not by CISF. \nTouts and some other undesirable elements are taking advantage of it and \nthereby indulging in illegal activities inside the airport. This lacuna  can also be \nexploited by terrorists / perpetrators for unlawful interference with civil aviation \noperations and therefore has serious implications from security point of view.  \n \n2. \nIn view of the above, it has been decided that the traffic wardens \ndeployed at segregation point in pax terminal building of airports shall be \nwithdrawn and replaced by  CISF personnel forthwith.  \n \n3. \nNecessary action in this regard may please be taken under \nintimation to this Bureau immediately.  \n \n \n \n(R.C. Tayal) \nAddl. Commissioner of Security (CA) \n \n \n \nRef : No. CAS-7(15)/2003.DIV-1 dated 21 Aug 2003"
