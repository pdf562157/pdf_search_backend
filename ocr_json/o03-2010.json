Each aircraft operator must establish, implement and maintain an \nappropriate written security programme that meets the requirements of the National Civil Aviation Security \nProgramme (NCASP) as well as any host State. \n \n1.1.2 \nAn aircraft operator security programme should be a clear and comprehensive document, \nfree of legal terms or jargon, and should be readily available to staff who are responsible for implementing \nsecurity measures. \n \n1.1.3 \nThe programme should be approved by the appropriate authority for aviation security of a \nhost State prior to its implementation in order to ensure consistency with the NCASP. States may prefer \nto develop a standard aircraft operator security programme for adaptation by each aircraft operator. \nAmendments or variations proposed by aircraft operators, other than minor changes, should be approved \nby the appropriate authority for aviation security before incorporation (guidance material with regard to \npreventive aviation security measures for aircraft operators that may be used as the basis for aircraft \noperator security programme contents covered in this Appendix may be found in Chapter 4). \n \n1.1.4 \nAn aircraft operator security programme should incorporate the following key elements: \n \na) security-specific definitions, abbreviations and acronyms; \n \nb) a programme objective, stressing the need to meet Annex 17, NCASPs and other \nnational and regional regulatory requirements; \n \nc) a reference to its legal basis, specifically the pertinent national legislation, NCASP \nprovisions, and other regulations; \n \nd) an organizational structure clearly enumerating the roles and duties of the different \nentities concerned with aviation security, including itself and other aircraft operators, \nthe airport security department, law enforcement agencies, national armed forces, \ncaterers, border control and other government agencies; \n \ne) a description of communication channels for exchanging security information, \nnormally between the relevant aviation security authority and the aircraft operator; \n \nf) \na description of security measures that serve to safeguard aircraft and their \noccupants and that apply to passengers, baggage, cargo, mail, catering supplies and \nstores, firearms and weapons, and all other people or items subject to control; \n \ng) a summary of security training requirements for relevant staff members, and related \ncertification criteria; and \n \nh) appendices that contain organizational diagrams, the contingency plan that covers \nresponses to acts of unlawful interference and other important information. \n \n1.1.5 \nOther useful elements that may be included in an aircraft operator security programme \nare: \n \na) a table of contents;",

The programme should be reviewed and updated by the chief security \nofficer at least once every 12 months. \n \n1.1.7 \nAn aircraft operator security programme is generally drafted to meet the requirements of \nthe NCASP and other regulations of the aircraft operator\u2019s home State. To address the need for aircraft \noperator security programme variations required by other States and perhaps an aircraft operator\u2019s \nspecial circumstances, aircraft operators should develop a supplementary Station Procedures \nProgramme that may be appended to the aircraft operator security programme. \n \n \nPOLICY AND ORGANIZATION \n \n1.1.8 \nAn aircraft operator security programme should be adopted as corporate policy, and \nshould describe the aircraft operator\u2019s policies and objectives with respect to security and call for the \nestablishment of a security department and chief security officer whose responsibilities involve achieving \nthe cited objectives. The programme should set out the related responsibilities of employees, handling \nagents and other contractors. The security measures described must be clearly defined and easily \nunderstood by those who need to implement them. \n \n1.1.9 \nAn aircraft operator security programme should have a security classification in \naccordance with national guidelines. \n \n1.1.10 \nIn developing an aircraft operator security programme, it is important to analyze the risk \nin depth and assess the nature and level of threat facing the operator. It is also necessary to consider \nnational and airport security requirements, programme implementation timelines, staffing and financial \nlimitations, and enhanced security requirements during times of increased threat. The applicability of the \naircraft operator security programme should also be appraised, since it may apply only to a particular \nairport or group of airports, a particular service or a specific State. \n \n \nPRIMARY OBJECTIVE \n \n1.1.11 \nThe primary objective of an aircraft operator security programme is to ensure the safety \nof passengers, crew and the general public by preventing acts of unlawful interference with civil aviation. \nTo that end, an aircraft operator security programme should: \n \na) meet or exceed the requirements of Annex 17 and the NCASPs of those States in \nwhich the aircraft operator operates; \n \nb) provide for standardized security measures and for clear security directives for crews, \nother employees, handling agents and contracted staff; \n \nc) provide for additional security measures in times of increased security threat; and",
  "6": "d) set performance standards, achievable through initial and recurrent training, and \nmonitored in accordance with record-keeping requirements set out in the aircraft \noperator security programme and/or the aircraft operator training programme. \n \n \nLEGAL AUTHORITY \n \n1.1.12 \nThe appropriate authority for aviation security should be empowered by national \nlegislation to assign responsibility, through regulations, to aircraft operators for the establishment, \nimplementation, and upkeep of their aircraft operator security programmes. \n \n \nDEFINITIONS \n \n1.1.13 \nAn aircraft operator security programme should promote a common understanding of \nspecific words and terms by presenting a set of definitions. Examples of terms that require an explanation \ninclude appropriate authority, NCASP, airport operator, aircraft operator, airport tenant, security restricted \narea, baggage, background check, catering stores/supplies, and regulated agent. \n \n \nINTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS \n \n1.1.14 \nAircraft operator security programmes should include a section that describes the \ninternational obligations that may apply to an aircraft operator, and should identify those international \norganizations whose work is relevant. The programmes should set out the role and structure of ICAO and \nother international organizations (e.g. European Civil Aviation Conference (ECAC)) whose rules and \nregulations may have a bearing on the company\u2019s operations. \n \n1.1.15 \nThe purpose of the aviation security conventions, Annex 17 and, where applicable, other \nrelevant standards and regulations (e.g. ECAC Document 30) may also be set out in aircraft operator \nsecurity programmes (guidance on an aircraft operator\u2019s international obligations under Annex 17 and \naviation security conventions may be found in Document 9734 \u2014 Oversight Manual, Part C \u2013 The \nEstablishment and Management of a State\u2019s Aviation Security Oversight System (Restricted)). \n \n \nNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS \n \n1.1.16 \nAircraft operator security programmes should include a section that describes the \nnational obligations and responsibilities that may apply to an aircraft operator. This section should identify \nthe relevant aviation security authority for the State of Registration. Reference should also be made to the \nNCASP and other regulations. As a rule, the NCASP and national regulations will state the responsibility \nof the aircraft operator for developing, implementing and maintaining an aircraft operator security \nprogramme. The company\u2019s senior management will usually delegate the task of meeting this \nresponsibility to its chief security officer, who should, among other tasks, ensure that the aircraft operator \nsecurity programme: \n \na) meets national legislation and NCASP requirements; \n \nb) is developed or modified to correct deficiencies and satisfy the operator\u2019s security \nneeds; \n \nc) is reviewed and updated regularly, and at least once every 12 months; and \n \nd) and any updates or amendments, are approved by the appropriate authority for \naviation security.",

A complete organizational chart, including the names \nand telephone numbers of the chief security officer and all security department directors, should be \nincluded in an appendix. \n \n1.1.20 \nSecurity department principles should also be set out, and should include: \n \na) clear terms of reference based on the responsibilities of the chief security officer; \n \nb) a clear order of command reflected in the structure of the department; \n \nc) the appropriate relationship between the security department and line management \n(although an aircraft operator\u2019s home base requires the bulk of security resources as \nthe majority of its assets are located there, this should not be at the expense of the \nnecessary support which must be given to line management at other locations); and \n \nd) the security department\u2019s relationship to all other company departments. \n \nDescription of operations \n \n1.1.21 \nAn aircraft operator security programme should incorporate a description of the \ncompany\u2019s operations, both generally (i.e. the company\u2019s nationality, location of its head office and \nregional offices, and extent and nature of its operations) and specifically, as it pertains to the State \nconcerned (i.e. the number of aircraft in service, volume of flights, quantity of passengers carried, and \nrelevant code-sharing/interline arrangements). \n \nClassification of materials \n \n1.1.22 \nAn aircraft operator security programme should include a statement on the classification \nand secure handling of sensitive information. Materials may be classified under terms such as \u201cFor \nOfficial Use Only\u201d or \u201cRestricted\u201d. Arrangements for protecting security-related sensitive information \nshould also be explained, and may involve limited distribution (on a need-to-know basis) and the storage \nof materials in a secure location. Protection and distribution procedures should be developed for both \npaper-based and electronic documents.",
  "8": "Aircraft operator security programme distribution \n \n1.1.23 \nAs a restricted document, an aircraft operator security programme should be protected \nfrom unauthorized access. The document should be available in part or in whole only to those with a bona \nfide need to know its contents. All entities and individuals provided with copies or portions of an aircraft \noperator security programme should be charged with protecting the information in their possession. A \ndistribution list should be provided as an appendix. \n \nDistribution of security documents \n \n1.1.24 \nNCASPs often specify methods for distributing security documents and reports. Such \ninformation should also be indicated in an aircraft operator security programme, together with directives \non how to distribute reports that may not be covered by the relevant NCASP, including reports on law \nenforcement actions or incidents, criminal records used in background checks, results of internal \ninspections, and security directives or information circulars issued by the appropriate authority for aviation \nsecurity. \n \nCommunications \n \n1.1.25 \nAn aircraft operator security programme should indicate how the appropriate authority for \naviation security keeps the aviation industry informed of NCASP requirements, and should describe the \npolicy for communicating with the State aviation security authority, other States, ICAO, and media outlets \nregarding aviation security. \n \n \nSECURITY OF AIRCRAFT \n \nGeneral \n \n1.1.26 \nBasic responsibility for aircraft security rests with the aircraft operator, whose principle \naim is to prevent trespassing. Since the first line of defence against unauthorized access is to safeguard \nthe airside boundary, a responsibility generally designated to the airport authority, an aircraft operator \nsecurity programme must take the Airport Security Programme (ASP) into account, ensuring a \ncoordinated effort and response. Where necessary, measures specific to an airport may be addressed in \na supplemental Station Procedures Programme. \n \n1.1.27 \nIn most situations, several entities are responsible for the protection of aircraft, notably \nthe airport, aircraft operator and law enforcement. This section of the aircraft operator security programme \nshould specifically describe each entity\u2019s role and responsibilities in this regard and should indicate the \ncommunications protocol between the aircraft operator and airport, to be followed in reporting suspicious \nactivity, the status of out-of-service aircraft, and information concerning an increased threat. The protocol \nalso applies to communications concerning extra security for more vulnerable flights and notification \nprovisions for special category passengers. \n \nAccess control \n \n1.1.28 \nAn aircraft operator security programme should describe measures for protecting aircraft \non the ground, which should be modelled on the procedures described in this volume. \n \nSecurity patrols \n \n1.1.29 \nAn aircraft operator security programme should describe how security patrols are utilized, \nand how patrolling security personnel communicate with the security control centre and local air traffic \ncontrol.",

It \nshould also indicate who is responsible for implementing the additional security measures considered \nnecessary to counter the threat. An aircraft operator security programme should assign responsibility for \ninforming the appropriate authority for aviation security of the situation in the event that threat notification \noriginates with another source. \n \nFlights under increased threat \n \n1.1.32 \nAn aircraft operator security programme should highlight the procedures to be followed \nfor specific flights facing a higher level of threat, including the use of isolated aircraft parking areas, \narrangements for guarding individual aircraft, deployment of an escort during taxiing, and inspection of \nthe areas underlying the approach and take-off paths. A parking space plan should also be appended. \n \nAircraft searches \n \n1.1.33 \nAn aircraft operator security programme should spell out procedures for inspecting and \nsearching aircraft during both routine operations and times of heightened threats, and should identify the \nagencies responsible for conducting a search as well as the necessity for using proper checklists, \nadequate lighting, and properly trained personnel supported by aircraft crew or aircraft engineering \nsupport staff. It is also important to describe the actions to be taken on discovery of suspect explosive \ndevices, and to indicate who is responsible for making decisions about moving or evacuating aircraft and \nsuspending airport operations. \n \n \nTRAVEL DOCUMENTS \n \n1.1.34 \nAn aircraft operator security programme should detail the check-in process, including \nspecial measures or facilities for groups or high-risk passengers, and should indicate procedures for \nprotecting tickets, boarding passes, baggage tags and other documents. \n \nNote.\u2014 With the elimination of paper tickets on 31 December 2007, this section of an aircraft operator \nsecurity programme will also need to describe procedures for preventing e-ticket fraud and electronic \ninformation theft. \n \n1.1.35 \nAn aircraft operator security programme should indicate where, when and how \nidentification and travel documents are checked with respect to originating, transfer and transit \npassengers. Where applicable, mention should be made of the authority and responsibility of handling \nagents under the provisions of an NCASP. \n \n1.1.36 \nAn aircraft operator security programme should also describe the procedures for \noff-airport or curb side check in of hold baggage, where applicable.",

A description of such responsibilities should \nbe included in an aircraft operator security programme.  \n \n \nAIRCRAFT CLEANING OPERATIONS \n \n1.1.64 \nAn aircraft operator security programme should explain the purpose of security measures \npertaining to aircraft cabin cleaning operations, and should provide a description of such measures \n(guidance may be found in Chapter 9). \n \n \nSECURITY OF CARGO AND MAIL \n \n1.1.65 \nAn aircraft operator security programme should indicate who is responsible for cargo and \nmail security, including screening operations. The legal authority for imposing such security measures \nshould be specifically cited. Security measures may vary depending on whether the operator specializes \nin passenger transportation, all-cargo or express courier operations. \n \n1.1.66 \nOperations away from home base may be handled by agents or contractors. Despite \nsuch arrangements, the aircraft operator remains responsible for the security of its cargo operations \nwhenever it has been given this responsibility by the host State (guidance on security measures for cargo \nand mail may be found in Chapter 7). \n \n1.1.67 \nThe aircraft operator security programme section on cargo and mail security should \ninclude the following elements: \n \na) the purpose of security measures for cargo and mail (including courier and express \nparcels); \n \nb) a description of security measures for cargo, including: the procedure for accepting a \ncargo consignment; the regulated agent scheme and criteria; the known consignor \nscheme and criteria; unknown shippers; the standard of screening and physical \nexamination; the location of screening and physical examination; details about the \noperator or service provider; and a list of exemptions from security screening or \nphysical examination;",

This may be achieved through provisions in an aircraft operator security programme and \nregulated agent security programme. \n \n1.1.70 \nTopics covered in an aircraft operator security programme may include whether there is a \nregulated agent programme for cargo, and should indicate who is responsible for certifying regulated \nagents. If there is no regulated agent programme, the aircraft operator security programme should \nindicate how cargo is processed and how security measures are applied. \n \n1.1.71 \nIn the context of the regulated agent security programme, the definition of \u201ccargo\u201d \nincludes unaccompanied baggage, mail and courier and/or express parcels. \n \nKnown shippers/consignors \n \n1.1.72 \nAn aircraft operator security programme should describe the procedures in place for \ncargo and mail that is not screened, such as the requirement for an operator to verify known shipper \nsecurity certification. Known shippers and consignors may also fall within the purview of a regulated agent \nprogramme. \n \nUnknown shippers \n \n1.1.73 \nShippers unknown to the regulated agent and/or aircraft operator should be subject to \nincreased scrutiny, including a requirement to provide proof of identity and agreement to have a \nconsignment screened according to a prescribed method, all of which should be described in the aircraft \noperator security programme. Furthermore, the air transport operator will need to establish procedures for \napplying security controls to unknown cargo so that all consignments become known cargo before they \nare allowed on an aircraft. \n \nTranshipments \n \n1.1.74 \nIf the aircraft operator is responsible for the security of transhipped cargo (i.e. cargo to be \ntransferred from one flight to another), the related security measures (e.g. screening arrangements, and \nprotection from tampering during storage) should be included in the aircraft operator security programme. \nA summary of such measures may be provided in cases where another party is responsible for their \napplication.",
  "16": "High value cargo \n \n1.1.75 \nThe security measures for handling and protecting high value cargo stored in cargo \nterminals and during aircraft loading and unloading, as well as during ground transport, should be \nenumerated. \n \nUnaccompanied baggage and/or personal effects \n \n1.1.76 \nAn aircraft operator security programme should include security measures for \nunaccompanied baggage that is shipped as cargo, should describe the standard of screening and manual \nsearches (usually the same as for an unknown shipper), and should provide details about the screening \nequipment and the operator or service provider. \n \nDiplomatic mail \n \n1.1.77 \nSecurity procedures for the carriage of diplomatic mail should be described (guidance \nmay be found in Section 3.4 and Chapter 7). \n \nProtection of cargo and mail \n \n1.1.78 \nAn aircraft operator security programme should indicate the measures in place for \nprotecting cargo and mail. If the security of the cargo facility is the responsibility of the aircraft operator, \ninformation concerning the facility\u2019s security procedures should be provided, including details concerning \nthe deployment of guards, and the use of patrols and closed-circuit television (CCTV) systems. If \nsurveillance cameras are installed, the aircraft operator security programme should indicate whether they \nare apart from or integrated with the airport\u2019s CCTV system. Information on building security should \nindicate whether it features a restricted area and whether staff are screened. It should also reveal how \ncargo and mail is transported to aircraft, among other things. \n \n \nAIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE AREAS \n \n1.1.79 \nSecurity measures in place for aircraft maintenance areas should be indicated whenever \nthe aircraft operator is responsible for such measures (e.g. if such areas are leased to the operator). At a \nminimum, a description of the maintenance area boundaries and controlled access procedures should be \nindicated. \n \n \nCODE SHARING \n \n1.1.80 \nClear lines of accountability are essential for implementing and subsequently monitoring \naviation security measures for flights which are conducted under code-sharing agreements. Different \narrangements, although generally compliant with Annex 17, may exist in the States of Registration of the \ncode share partners, and such differences need to be resolved. \n \n1.1.81 \nThe State of Registration determines the security arrangements to be adopted by an \naircraft operator under its sovereign control. Any additional security measures or different applications \ncalled for by the code-sharing partner will need to be addressed by the operators concerned, and \nappended to the aircraft operator security programme. \n \n1.1.82 \nCode-sharing partners should have a clear line of communication regarding such matters \nas risk and threat assessments. Specifics about the method of communication, contact details, and so on, \nshould be in the relevant appendix. e.g. a code-sharing operator should advise its partner any time there \nis a security breach or details of a heightened threat to its operation which call for additional security \narrangements. The State of Registration of each code-sharing partner should also be informed of the \nspecific threat and the additional measures proposed to counter it.",
  "17": "TRAINING \n \nSecurity awareness training \n \n1.1.83 \nAll staff should undergo security awareness training. Training aspects that should be \nnoted in an aircraft operator security programme include the categories of training, designation of those \nresponsible for providing training, methods employed (e.g. video, classroom discussion, pamphlet, etc.), \nspecific topics, the requirement to maintain training records, provisions for recurrent training, etc. \n \nSecurity training \n \n1.1.84 \nAn aircraft operator security programme should call for all frontline personnel, such as \ncheck-in agents, screening staff and cabin crew, to undergo specialized training. Details about such \ntraining should be provided, including the topics covered and the number of hours. An aircraft operator \nsecurity programme should also address which job positions require certification, licensing, or \nauthorization, with the approval of the appropriate authority for aviation security or another relevant \nauthority. \n \nRecruitment and background checks \n \n1.1.85 \nInformation on the aircraft operator\u2019s recruitment methods, including the use of \nbackground checks, should be provided in the aircraft operator security programme (guidance may be \nfound in Volume II). This section should state, for example, whether any laws preclude a criminal history \ncheck and what sort of information must be provided by the job applicant. \n \n1.1.86 \nDetails should also be provided about the process involved in handling a job application \nsubmission, including the identity of the department responsible for processing applications (including \nbackground checks, if applicable), and the policy on contacting former employers or character references \nfor verification of information, among other items. \n \n1.1.87 \nProcedures to be conducted after completing a background check should also be spelled \nout, including whether there is a requirement for records of applications to be kept on file and, if so, by \nwhom and for how long. \n \nSecurity training programme \n \n1.1.88 \nIf the development, implementation and upkeep of an aircraft operator security training \nprogramme is required by the appropriate authority for aviation security, a copy of the training programme \nshould be appended to an aircraft operator security programme.

  "18": "QUALITY CONTROL \n \n1.1.91 \nAircraft operators may be required by a NCASP or other regulations to develop, \nimplement and maintain a quality control programme for their security operations. In this case, a summary \nof quality control measures should be included in the aircraft operator security programme, with the \nprogramme itself appended. If a State does not require a quality control programme, such measures \nshould be comprehensively addressed in the aircraft operator security programme. Alternatively, an \noperator could produce a separate quality control programme and cross-reference this with the aircraft \noperator security programme. \n \n \nLOCAL AIRPORT PROCEDURES \n \n1.1.92 \nLocal airport responsibilities with regard to the security of aircraft operations that have not \nalready been addressed in an aircraft operator security programme should be covered in the aircraft \noperator station procedures programme. \n \n \nPROTECTION OF EXECUTIVES AND OTHER PERSONNEL \n \n1.1.93 \nAlthough not necessarily directly related to the prevention of unlawful acts against civil \naviation, an aircraft operator security programme should address security measures for executives or \ncrew members (and their families) who may be targeted by criminal elements during business trips or \nlayovers. Such measures are normally based on risk assessment and threat analysis. \n \n \nBUILDING PROTECTION \n \n1.1.94 \nOffice buildings that accommodate aircraft operator executives and senior managers \nrequire protection that is commensurate with the risk and threat levels associated with the building \nlocation.

Threats may be related to the nature of the \ncompany\u2019s business, the location of its operations, its nationality, the State of aircraft Registration, a \npassenger\u2019s profile or the value of goods carried. Information on the various kinds of threats facing an \noperator comes from a variety of sources; in developing and maintaining a current threat assessment for \ndifferent operational areas, the flight department manager should rely on the following resources, as \nappropriate: \n \na) national and local security officials; \n \nb) national and local law enforcement officials; \n \nc) the company security officer, if applicable; \n \nd) national and international trade associations; \n \ne) air security assessment and intelligence service providers; \n \nf) \nlocal and foreign media reports; and \n \ng) company officials posted in foreign locations, if applicable. \n \n1.1.3 \nSecurity professionals may provide assistance in determining and assessing the flight \ndepartment\u2019s vulnerabilities. \n \n \nPREVENTIVE SECURITY MEASURES \n \n1.1.4 \nThe focus of preventive security measures is on preventing: \n \na) unauthorized access to company aircraft and facilities;  \n \nb) the introduction of unauthorized weapons or explosives to company aircraft or \nfacilities; and \n \nc) the use of company aircraft to commit unlawful acts, such as the transport of illicit \ndrugs. \n \n1.1.5 \nSecurity measures implemented by the operator should be proportional to the threat. The \nprocedures and training in place should lead to enhanced measures whenever the threat rises, and a \nreduction in measures when the threat diminishes.",
