Radiological Detection Equipment (RDE) is used to detect any radiological\nmaterial present in baggage, vehicle or passenger for security at the entry/ exit\npoints of Airport. If the initial check shows the radiation level above the\npermissible limit it will raise an alarm and automatically capture the image of the\nperson or the vehicle. As the alarm is raised, security personnel will check the\nbaggage or the vehicle with the portable survey meter and if the survey meter\nshows the radiation level above the limits then the security staff will ask for the\nvalid certificate for carrying the radio-isotope. Baggage will be confiscated if no\nvalid documents are shown and Department of Atomic Energy will be informed,\nas per Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) issued by BCAS vide AVSEC Circular\n01/2020 dated 07.02.2020.\n\n2. The purpose of primary benefit of Radiological Detection Equipment is that it\nsignificantly improves the overall safety of people and facilities, by detecting any\nradiological substances, these tools/equipment helps to prevent any potential\naccidents/incidents involving radiation exposure\n\n3. Radioactive detection devices will contribute to safeguarding national security\nby monitoring and detecting including attempts to smuggle radioactive materials\nacross borders or into sensitive areas.\n\n4. These detectors can quickly locate sources of radiation which allows for proper\nhandling and disposal. This ensures the preservation of ecological systems while\nalso mitigating any health risks associated with radioactivity.\n\n5. Airport Operator shall decide the requirement of RDE to be provided at the\nairport premises (Type and number) by conducting detailed survey of airport (\nsecurity standing committee) from the following RDEs.:-\n\nisRadiation Portal Monitor for Pedestrian\n\nii, Radiation Portal Monitor for Vehicle\niii. Radiation Portal Monitor for Baggage\niv.Handheld Gamma Survey Meter\nv.Radionuclide Identification Device\n\n6. The concerned Airport operator, in consultation with BCAS, CASO shall jointly\ndecide the site for installation of Radiological Detection Equipment.\n\n7. The equipment shall be compact, fully solid state, highly reliable and shall use\nlatest state of the art technology.\n\n8. The system has to be designed to operate for 24 hours a day, throughout the\nyear.\n\n9. The design of equipment shall be consistent with the requirements of long-term\ntrouble-free operation with highest degree of reliability and maintainability.\n\nThis document contains sensitive aviation security information which is regulated under rules 54 and 55 of the\nAircraft (Security) Rules, 2023.
