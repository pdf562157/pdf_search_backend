Delhicy\nNo.0-4201 1/APC/OPS(2)/Circular/AS/07 - 46/3 Dated.e\u00a2 April\u2019 2008, .\n\nCIRCULAR NO. AS- 03/2008 S\nSubject: USE OF EXPLOSIVE DETECTION SYSTEM AT THE\n\nAIRPORTS: REGARDING.\n\nIn order to strengthen pre-embarkation security checks, BCAS\ncircular No. 03/2006 dated 05.05.2006 stipulates the installation of one , )\nExplosive Detection System (EDS) for every two X-BIS machines. As far as *\nthe ASGs of CISF are concerned, these EDS are to be primarily utilised in O\nthe SHAs as a complement to the X-BIS screening of hand baggage. This fe)\nHQ had also instructed that SOPs should be drafted for the judicious use of\nthese equipments. Though the EDS have been procured and issued to the \u00a9\nCISF at a majority of airports, feedback suggests. that they need to be fe)\nutilized in a systematic way by the ASGs so that any unauthorized\nexplosive being carried in the Cabin baggage cannot escape detection. \u201c\u00b0\nExplosive Trace Detection Equipments will be used for random/routine\nchecking to resolve a specific concern identified through a visual/physical\nexamination of an item.\n\n02. Following instructions are being issued for effective utilization and\noperation/ handling of the EDS by the ASGs :-\n\n(i) Installation:\n\nThe EDS should be installed in SHA near the search station\nwhere physical checking of hand baggage is done, for operational\nfeasibility without causing inconvenience to the airport users (pax/\nstaff) during screening. It should be installed in such a way that as\nfar as possible, it is hidden from the view of the public/pax. Its\nscreen should not be viewable by the pax. It may be pointed out\nhere that at some places, it is seen to have been installed in such a\nway as if it has to be showcased and advertised to the public/pax.\n\n~-This should be avoided in consultation with the airport operator.\n\n(i) Training:\n\nSufficient number of certified screeners will be got trained for\nEDS screening (operations and handling) and only trained\npersonnel will be deployed for screening. The EDS screener will be\ndesignated as Trace Detection Operator (TDO). Initially, the\n",
  "2": "2\u00b0\n\no=-\n\nis)\ncy\noO\nQO\n\nOo\n\n(vi)\n\noperators may be trained through the vendor/manufacturer.\nRefresher training should be undertaken at intervals not exceeding\n13 months. Refresher training should also be provided to those,\nwho although having been trained within the previous 13 months,\nhave not undertaken the task for a period exceeding 3 months.\n\nDeployment:\n\nIn every shift, appropriately trained EDS screener(s), who\nis/are obviously certified screener(s) also should be earmarked as\nTDO from among the screeners in SHA for each EDS. The screener\n\u2018so earmarked will perform EDS \u2018screening in addition to his routine\nduties of pre-embarkation security checks. In the event of the EDS\nbeing taken to a place outside the SHA, the same earmarked TDO\nwill conduct the screening.\n\nMaintenance:\n\nThe EDS\u2019 equipment will be maintained properly by\nappropriately trained personnel and kept in safe custody assigning\nspecific responsibility for the same. A register be opened for this\npurpose having daily record of operation as well as regular\nmaintenance (explained in detail at point xili,below). The\nmaintenance of the system will be properly recorded and the\ndifficulty in handling/operations, if any will be immediately got\naddressed through the airport operator. The Terminal I/C or shift In-\ncharge of ASG will be given responsibility in this regard.\n\nUtilisation:\n\nThough the EDS will be installed in SHA for screening during\npre-embarkation security checks, it may, if so required, also used\nfor detection of presence of explosives on persons (passengers,\nairport staff, labours etc) baggage, vehicles, unattended\nbaggage/items etc at other places in airport premises. The items to\nbe checked/screened through EDS will include those which are\ndifficult to effectively search by hand. The following items will be\nconsidered for screening through EDS,\n\na) Electric, electronic and battery operated items;\n\nb) Items specifically referred to by an x-ray screener if the concerns\nrelate to the possibility of explosives;\n\nc) Footwear;\n\nd) The inner lining of baggage, concentrating on seams and joints.\n\nFrequency of use:\n\nApplication of EDS checking on baggage will be done in a\nlogical way based on two criteria. Firstly based on realistic/factual\nattribute/suspected image, in which any Image screened by the X-\nBIS, if found to be suspicious (containing any suspect explosives or\n\n<\n\noO\noO\nfo)\noO\n\n=)\n\non: Omens,\n",
  "3": "20909009000 my\n\nie)\n\n1ED components) will be screened by the EDS by the earmarked\nEDS screener(TDO). Secondly, random screening in which a\npredetermined ratio of the baggage will be checked by EDS (in\naddition to the mandatory X-BIS screening). The following\n\u2018suggested patterns/ frequency are given for baseline, intermediate\nand. high threat conditions and the shift /C will decide which of the\nfollowing frequency is to be adopted in a particular period/shift.\n\na. Baseline \u2014 : One out of 20 baggage to be checked by EDS.\n\nb. Intermediate: One out of 10 baggage to be checked by EDS.\n\nce. High : One out of 05 baggage to be checked by EDS.\n\nIn the event of a specific threat to any aircraft, 100% checking\nby EDS may be resorted to, depending on the situation.\n\n(vil) Profiling:\n\n(vil)\n\n(ix)\n\n&)\n\nWhile deciding which baggage to be checked, screeners may\nexercise marginal discretion depending on the profiling of the\npassengers. For example, pax travelling to and from states afflicted\nby insurgency should specifically be selected for random checking.\nLikewise, baggage of the passengers travelling from the flights\noperating to and from western countries, which have been generally\nperceived to have greater threat perception, should be selected for\nrandom check. Obviously, the baggage profiling in this regard will\n\nchange according to the threat perception at a particular time and\nplace(s).\n\nQperational Reaction:\n\nIf the X-BIS image shows the presence of a complete circuit with\norganic substances e.g. power source, switch, detonator, main\ncharge (Explosive), delay mechanism, essential ingredients of IED\neither combined together or placed at different locations inside the\nbaggage, such baggage shall be immediately stopped in the tunnel\n\n\u201candthe owner/carrier detained and interrogated carefully by\navoiding leading questions. Further handling of such a baggage\nshould be as per the BDDS drill.\n\nIn the event of detection of unattended/unclaimed baggage, all\nprecautions as per SOP should be ensured for its handling and\nscreening by the EDS. In the event of positive signals for explosive,\n\ncomplete Bomb threat exercise should be carried out as per\nprocedure.\n\nAll unattended baggage/items shall be treated as\n\u201csuspected\u201d. They shall not be touched or disturbed before they\nare cleared by the explosives expert. While checking the\nunattended items/baggage found, the EDS operator shall not\ndisturb such baggage / item even though EDS shows no presence \u2014\nof explosives. Such baggage/items may be subjected to further\n\n3\n\n(s)\n\noO\noO\noO\n\na\n\nso000\n",

WORDS OF CAUTION\n\nIt may be noted that these are trace detectors which detect traces of explosives\nfrom the swabs collected from the suspected bags by physically running over the swab\nhandles over the suspected bags. The wand has to be pressed and wiped firmly against\nthe bag to collect the samples effectively. This involves physically disturbing the bags. It\nis not possible to take effective swabs from the suspected bag without\ntouching/disturbing it. These are meant to check only the cabin baggage brought in by\nthe PAX himself at the SHA for carriage in the aircraft cabin. However, If required these\nmay be used to pick-up and test the swabs from the bags of suspected persons who are\nphysically present at the scenetor suspected bags whose owners are available at the\nsite.-Similarly-these can be used to check those bags in which only explosives are\nsuspected and it is definitely known that no detonators/power source or any initiating\nmechanism is present in the bag. However, it will need extreme caution and precaution\neven under those situations.\n\nPage 6 of 6\n",
