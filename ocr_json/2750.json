The on-duty ASG personnel failed\nto notice it and further deposit the said item in the Lost and Found Section of the airport, which\nis in contravention of the instructions issued by this HQ in the context. Further, the CCTV\nfootage of the incident was also not saved by the concerned airport failing to appreciate its\nfuture perspective. Thus, it got automatically overridden after the predefined storage period.\n2. \nAPS HQ has issued specific instruction./SOp to deal with unattended property vide letter\nNo. (990f) dated 12.09.2011. Therefore, it is once again requested to sensitize ASG personnel\nfor the strict implementation of the relevant S(:;P. Apart from this, the Airport Operator must\nalso be suitably sensitized to brief its staff on the procedure for handling of unattended\nproperties at airports.\n3. \nBesides, being the custodian of the X-BIS setup area, the responsibility of ASG personnel\ncan not be undermined either. Hence, it is requested to brief all personnel especially those\ninvolved in PESC to be more vigilant and aware of the surroundings. The activities of other staff\nworking around should invariably be kept under conscious watch to avoid occurence of such\nincidents.\n4' \nFurther, the non retention of the ccw footage is also not an acceptable procedure. The\nfootage of contentious issues like passenger complaints/incidents must be saved as a default\nmethod to judiciously handle such complaints at a later stage.\n5. \nPersonal attention of DIsG/CASOs of ali nSGs to the subject matter is highly anticipated.\n6. \nThis is issued with the approval of the Ccimpetent Authority.\nCopy to:\n]G/APS ]I\nkash, IPS)\nFor kind information please.\nlblae",
