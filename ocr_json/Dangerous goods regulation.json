  "21": "INTRODUCTION\nPURPOSE OF THE DANGEROUS GOODS REGULATIONS\nThe IATA Dangerous Goods Regulations are published in order to provide procedures for the shipper and the\noperator by which articles and substances with hazardous properties can be safely transported by air on all\ncommercial air transport.\nIn 1953, the Member airlines of IATA recognized the growing need to transport by air, articles and substances\nhaving hazardous properties which, if uncontrolled, could adversely affect the safety of the passengers, crew\nand/or aircraft on which they are carried. Experience in other modes of transport had demonstrated that most\nsuch articles and substances could be carried safely provided that the article or substance was properly\npacked and the quantities in each package were properly limited. Using this experience together with the\nindustry's knowledge of the specialized characteristics of air transport, IATA developed the first regulations for\nthe transport of dangerous goods by air. The first edition of the IATA Dangerous Goods Regulations was\npublished in 1956 as the IATA Restricted Articles Regulations.\nGENERAL PHILOSOPHY\nDangerous goods can be transported safely by air transport provided certain principles are strictly followed.\nThe IATA Dangerous Goods Regulations is an easy-to-use manual based on the International Civil Aviation\nOrganization (ICAO) Technical Instructions for the Safe Transport of Dangerous Goods by Air. It incorporates\nadditional operational requirements, which provide a harmonized system for operators to accept and transport\ndangerous goods safely and efficiently.\nThe Regulations include a detailed list of individual articles and substances specifying the United Nations\nclassification of each article or substance and their acceptability for air transport as well as the conditions for\ntheir transport. Since no listing can be complete, the list also includes many generic or \u201cnot otherwise\nspecified\u201d entries to assist in the classification of those articles or substances not listed by name.\nSome dangerous goods have been identified as being too dangerous to be carried on any aircraft under any\ncircumstances; others are forbidden under normal circumstances but may be carried with specific approvals\nfrom the States concerned; some are restricted to carriage on all cargo aircraft; most however, can be safely\ncarried on passenger aircraft as well, provided certain requirements are met.\nPackaging is the essential component in the safe transport of dangerous goods by air. The IATA Dangerous\nGoods Regulations provide packing instructions for all dangerous goods acceptable for air transport with a\nwide range of options for inner, outer and single packagings. The packing instructions normally require the\nuse of UN performance-tested specification packagings, however these are not required when dangerous\ngoods are shipped in Limited Quantities under the provisions of Limited Quantity \u201cY\u201d Packing Instructions. The\nquantity of dangerous goods permitted within these packagings is strictly limited by the Regulations so as to\nminimize the risk should an incident occur.\nTraining is also an essential element in maintaining a safe regulatory regime. It is necessary for all individuals\ninvolved in the preparation or transport of dangerous goods to be properly trained to carry out their\nresponsibilities. Depending on the job-function, this may entail only familiarization training or may also include\nmore detailed training in the intricacies of the Regulations. It is important to remember that dangerous goods\nare very unlikely to cause a problem when they are prepared and handled in compliance with the IATA\nDangerous Goods Regulations.\nThe proper declaration of dangerous goods by the shipper ensures that all in the transportation chain know\nwhat dangerous goods they are transporting, how to properly load and handle them and what to do if an\nincident or accident occurs either in-flight or on the ground. The pilot-in-command must know what is on board\nthe aircraft in order to properly deal with any emergencies, which may occur. The pilot must also convey this\ninformation, if possible, to air traffic services to aid in the response to any aircraft incident or accident.\n54th EDITION, 1 JANUARY 2013\nxix",
  "22": "Dangerous Goods Regulations\nInformation regarding \u201cHidden Dangerous Goods\u201d must also be conveyed to passengers to assist them in\nrecognizing dangerous goods, which they are not permitted to carry on their person or in their baggage and\nwhich may not be readily recognizable as being dangerous.\nLastly, dangerous goods accidents or incidents must be reported, so that an investigation by the relevant\nauthorities can establish the cause and take corrective action. Also, if as a result of these investigations\nchanges are required in the Regulations, appropriate regulatory action can be taken without delay.\n54th EDITION, 1 JANUARY 2013\nxx",
  "23": "Introduction\nSIGNIFICANT CHANGES AND AMENDMENTS TO THE 54TH EDITION (2013)\nThe 54th edition of the IATA Dangerous Goods Regulations incorporates all amendments made by the\nDangerous Goods Board and includes changes to the 2013\u20132014 edition of the ICAO Technical Instructions.\nThe following list is intended to assist the user to identify the main changes introduced in this edition and must\nnot be considered an exhaustive listing.

  "25": "Introduction\nA190\u2014provides an allowance for neutron radiation detectors which contain boron trifluoride, normally\nforbidden/forbidden, to be shipped on a cargo aircraft provided the provisions of A190 are met. A190 provides\nfor the transport of these radiation detectors containing no more than 1 g of boron trifluoride to be shipped as\ncargo as not restricted.\nA191\u2014provides for an exception to the requirement for manufactured articles containing mercury to have to\nshow the Division 6.1 subsidiary risk on the Shipper's Declaration and for the packages to have to bear a\nToxic hazard label.\n5\u2014Packing\nPacking Instructions\nAlmost all of the packing instructions have been revised to include closed head drums (1A1, 1B1, 1H1 and\n1N1) and/or other metal boxes (4N) as outer packagings.\n218\u2014is the new packing instruction to address the new chemical under pressure entries (UN 3500 to\nUN 3505).\nThe absorbent material requirements in Packing Instructions 350, 351, 360, 361, 373, Y373, 493, 494, 553,\n651, 652, 657, 658, 680, 850 and 854 have been revised to require sufficient absorbent material to absorb the\nentire contents of the inner packagings.\n370 and Y370\u2014have been revised to include provisions for a base material in Packing Group III, which has a\nhigher net quantity. There is no change to the permitted quantity of organic peroxide.\nY373, Y680 and Y840\u2014have been revised to add in additional packing requirements for glass inner\npackagings to be packed with sufficient absorbent material to absorb the entire contents of the inner\npackagings and placed in a rigid leakproof receptacle before being packed in the outer packaging.\n377 and 681\u2014have been revised to reflect that the chlorosilanes assigned to these packing instructions are\nnow not permitted on passenger aircraft.\n869\u2014which applies to mercury contained in manufactured articles has been completely revised.\n955\u2014a provision has been added to permit packages containing life-saving appliances, which contain no\ndangerous goods other than a Division 2.2 gas for inflation purposes, to be shipped in strong outer\npackagings up to a maximum weight of 40 kg gross as cargo and to be considered as not restricted.\n965 and 968\u2014the packing instructions applicable to lithium ion and lithium metal batteries have been revised\nto limit the quantity of lithium batteries that may be placed in a package under the provisions of Section II. A\nnew Section IB has been added to these packing instructions that permit small lithium batteries meeting the\ngeneral requirements of Section II to continue to be shipped in non-UN specification packagings up to a total\npackage weight of 10 kg. Shipments prepared according to Section IB are subject to all of the applicable\nrequirements of these Regulations, including that for dangerous goods training.

The smallest external dimension must be not less than 100 mm.\nAlternative packagings for the transport of animal material may be authorized by the competent authority in accordance\nwith the provisions in 5.0.6.7.\nWhatever the intended temperature of the consignment, the primary receptacle or the secondary packaging must be\ncapable of withstanding, without leakage, an internal pressure producing a pressure differential of not less than 95 kPa\n(0.95 bar) and temperatures in the range of -40\u00b0C to 55\u00b0C.\nNote:\nThe capability of a packaging to withstand an internal pressure without leakage that produces the specified pressure\ndifferential should be determined by testing samples of primary receptacles or secondary packagings. Pressure differential\nis the difference between the pressure exerted on the inside of the receptacle or packaging and the pressure on the\noutside. The appropriate test method should be selected based on receptacle or packaging type. Acceptable test methods\ninclude any method that produces the required pressure differential between the inside and outside of a primary\nreceptacle or a secondary packaging. The test may be conducted using internal hydraulic or pneumatic pressure (gauge)\nor external vacuum test methods. Internal hydraulic or pneumatic pressure can be applied in most cases as the required\npressure differential can be achieved under most circumstances. An external vacuum test is not acceptable if the specified\npressure differential is not achieved and maintained. The external vacuum test is a generally acceptable method for rigid\nreceptacles and packagings but is not normally acceptable for:\n\u2013\nflexible receptacles and flexible packagings;\n\u2013\nreceptacles and packagings filled and closed under a absolute atmospheric pressure lower than 95 kPa.\nAdditional Requirements\nInner packagings containing infectious substances must not be consolidated with inner packagings containing unrelated\ntypes of goods. Complete packages may be overpacked in accordance with the provisions of 5.0.1.5.\nOther dangerous goods must not be packed in the same packaging as Division 6.2 Infectious Substances unless they are\nnecessary for maintaining the viability, stabilizing or preventing degradation or neutralizing the hazards of the infectious\nsubstances. A quantity of 30 mL or less of dangerous goods included in Classes 3, 8, or 9 may be packed in each primary\nreceptacle containing infectious substances provided these substances meet the requirements of 2.6. When these small\nquantities of dangerous goods are packed with infectious substances in accordance with this packing instruction, no other\nrequirements in these Regulations need be met.\nWhen the infectious substances to be transported are unknown but suspected of meeting the criteria for inclusion in\nCategory A, the words \u201cSuspected Category A Infectious Substance\u201d must be shown in parentheses following the proper\nshipping name on the itemized list of contents inside the outer packaging.\n54th EDITION, 1 JANUARY 2013\n486\n620",

Secondary packagings must be\nsecured in outer packagings with suitable cushioning material. Any leakage of the contents must not compromise the\nintegrity of the cushioning material or of the outer packaging.\nPackages must be prepared as follows:\n(a) For liquid substances:\n1.\nThe primary receptacle(s) must be leakproof and must not contain more than 1 L;\n2.\nThe secondary packaging must be leakproof;\n3.\nIf multiple fragile primary receptacles are placed in a single secondary packaging, they must be either individually\n5\nwrapped or separated to prevent contact between them;\n4.\nAbsorbent material must be placed between the primary receptacle and the secondary packaging.

This quantity excludes ice, dry ice or liquid nitrogen when\nused to keep specimens cold.\nNote:\nThe capability of a packaging to withstand an internal pressure without leakage that produces the specified\npressure differential should be determined by testing samples of primary receptacles or secondary packagings.\nPressure differential is the difference between the pressure exerted on the inside of the receptacle or packaging\nand the pressure on the outside. The appropriate test method should be selected based on receptacle or\npackaging type. Acceptable test methods include any method that produces the required pressure differential\nbetween the inside and outside of a primary receptacle or a secondary packaging. The test may be conducted\nusing internal hydraulic or pneumatic pressure (gauge) or external vacuum test methods. Internal hydraulic or\npneumatic pressure can be applied in most cases as the required pressure differential can be achieved under\nmost circumstances. An external vacuum test is not acceptable if the specified pressure differential is not\nachieved and maintained. The external vacuum test is a generally acceptable method for rigid receptacles and\npackagings but is not normally acceptable for:\n\u2013\nflexible receptacles and flexible packagings;\n\u2013\nreceptacles and packagings filled and closed under a absolute atmospheric pressure lower than 95 kPa.\n(b) For solid substances:\n1.\nThe primary receptacle(s) must be siftproof and must not exceed the outer packaging weight limit;\n2.\nThe secondary packaging must be siftproof;\n3.\nIf multiple fragile primary receptacles are placed in a single secondary packaging, they must be either individually\nwrapped or separated to prevent contact between them;\n4.\nExcept for packages containing body parts, organs or whole bodies, the outer packaging must not contain more\nthan 4 kg. This quantity excludes ice, dry ice or liquid nitrogen when used to keep specimens cold;\n5.\nIf there is any doubt as to whether or not residual liquid may be present in the primary receptacle during transport\nthen a packaging suitable for liquids, including absorbent materials, must be used.\nAn itemized list of contents must be enclosed between the secondary packaging and the outer packaging.\nAt least one surface of the outer packaging must have a minimum dimension of 100 mm \u00d7 100 mm.\nThe completed package must be capable of successfully passing the drop test described in 6.5.4.4 as specified in 6.5.4.2\nexcept that the height of the drop must not be less than 1.2 m.

  "718": "Description of the occurrence (continuation):\nNote:\n1.\nAny type of dangerous goods occurrence must be reported, irrespective of whether the dangerous goods are contained\nin cargo, mail or baggage.\n2.\nA dangerous goods accident is an occurrence associated with and related to the transport of dangerous goods which\nresults in fatal or serious injury to a person or major property damage. For this purpose, a serious injury is an injury\nwhich is sustained by a person in an accident and which: (a) requires hospitalisation for more than 48 hours, commenc-\ning from the time the injury was received; (b) results in a fracture of any bones (except small fractures of fingers, toes, or\nnose); (c) involves lacerations which cause severe haemorrhage, nerve, muscle or tendon damage; (d) involves injury to\nany internal organ; (e) involves second or third degree burns; or any burns affecting more than 5% of the body surface;\nor (f) involves verified exposure to infectious substances or injurious radiation. A dangerous goods accident may also be\nan aircraft accident; in which case the normal procedure for dangerous goods accidents must be followed.\n3.\nA dangerous goods incident is an occurrence, other than a dangerous goods accident, associated with and related to\nthe transport of dangerous goods, not necessarily occurring on board an aircraft, which results in injury to a person,\nproperty damage, fire, breakage, spillage, leakage of fluid or radiation or other evidence that the integrity of the packag-\ning has not been maintained. Any occurrence relating to the transport of dangerous goods which seriously jeopardises\nthe aircraft or its occupants is also deemed to constitute a dangerous goods incident.\n4.\nThis form may also be used to report any occasion when undeclared or misdeclared dangerous goods are discovered in\ncargo or when baggage contains dangerous goods which passengers are not permitted to take on board aircraft.\n5.\nAn initial report should be dispatched within 72 hours of the occurrence, unless exceptional circumstances prevent this.\nThe initial report may be made by any means but a written report should be sent as soon as possible, even if all the\ninformation is not available.\n6.\nCompleted reports are normally sent to the competent authority.\n7.\nCopies of all relevant documents should be included with the report.\n8.\nProviding it is safe to do so, all dangerous goods, packagings, documents etc. relating to the occurrence must be\nretained until after the initial report has been made.\n9.\nRequirements and procedures differ from state to state, it is recommended that the local competent authority be\ncontacted in order to clarify the exact procedures to be followed in the event of a dangerous goods incident or accident.\nDangerous Goods Regulations\nFIGURE 9.6.A\nDangerous Goods Occurrence Report (contd.)\n9\n9.9\n54th EDITION, 1 JANUARY 2013\n684",
