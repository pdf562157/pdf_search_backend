ICAO promulgates\nStandards and Recommended Practices (SARPs) in respect of civil aviation security through Annex 17\nof the Chicago Convention, 1944. Requirements of 12th edition of Annex 17 are reflected in this\ndocument.\n\nBeing a signatory to the Convention on International Civil Aviation (Chicago Convention, 1944), the\nRepublic of India is obliged to implement the Standards and Recommended Practices (SARPs) adopted\nby the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) through the National Civil Aviation Security\nProgramme (NCASP), a policy document required by Standard 3.1.1 of Annex 17 of the Chicago\nConvention which is applicable from 21 February 2024. Annex 17 further mandates each contracting\nState as follows:\n\n3.5.1 Each Contracting State shall require the appropriate authority to develop, implement and maintain\na national civil aviation security quality control programme to regularly determine compliance with and\nvalidate the effectiveness of its national civil aviation security programme. The priorities and frequency\nof oversight activities shall be determined on the basis of risk assessments carried out by the relevant\nauthorities, and include security audits, inspections and tests 10 provide for the rapid and effective\nrectification of any deficiencies.

This shall be achieved through the implementation of a \nprogramme of security audits, inspections, tests, and exercises by BCAS and through similar \ninternal quality control measures conducted by airport operators, aircraft operators, regulated \nagents, catering establishments, and other entities entrusted with civil aviation security \nresponsibilities mandated in the NCASP. \n1.1.2 The NCASQCP also provides a framework to address and resolve deficiencies identified during \nquality control activities and identifies all aspects of security measures that may need changes in \naviation security legislative instruments, AVSEC orders, circulars, directives, office \nmemorandums, NCASP, etc. It is of paramount importance that entities responsible for the \nmanagement, setting of priorities, and organization of the National Civil Aviation Quality \nControl Programme operate independently from those responsible for the implementation of \nmeasures under the National Civil Aviation Security Programme. \n1.1.3 A fundamental component of an aviation security system is the effective implementation of \nquality control measures. In the aviation security context, quality control measures can be defined \nas the surveillance techniques and activities used to assess the aviation security system of India \nand, where required, to resolve identified deficiencies. In order to implement quality control \nmeasures, Appropriate Authority of Civil Aviation Security of India shall develop, implement \nand maintain a National Civil Aviation Security Quality Control Programme (NCASQCP).  \n1.1.4 Annex 17 of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) is the primary source of \nStandards and Recommended Practices (SARPs) for the establishment and management of a \nState\u2019s national civil aviation system. The fundamental challenge for the establishment and \nmanagement of such a civil aviation security system is to create an aviation security regime that \nis highly effective in preventing acts of unlawful interference and ensuring compliance with \nspecific regulations without unduly interfering with the efficiency of civil aviation, imposing \nexcessive costs or intruding unnecessarily into private rights or civil liberties.  \n \n1.2 Authority to develop, maintain and oversee the NCASQCP: \n1.2.1 Director General (DG), BCAS, has authority to develop, implement, maintain, and oversee the \nNCASQCP (National Civil Aviation Security Quality Control Programme). DG BCAS also has \nthe authority to review the NCASQCP to determine compliance with and validate the \neffectiveness of its National Civil Aviation Security Programme. \n \n1.2.2 The NCASQCP has been established in accordance with: \na. ICAO Annex 17, SARPs and selected guidance materials from Aviation Security Manual \nDoc. 8973. \nb. The Aircraft Act, 1934 \nc. The Aircraft (Security) Rules, 2023 \nd.
