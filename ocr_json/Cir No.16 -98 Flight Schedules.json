  "1": "CIRCULAR  16  /  1998 \n \n \nSUB: FLIGHT SCHEDULES \n \n \nIt has been observed that certain Airlines rush up their requests for changes in their \nexisting flight schedule / allotment of additional flight schedule at the eleventh hours and \nalmost every week, making it difficult to examine and process the same in such a short \nduration and that too so frequently. \n \n \nIt has, therefore, been decided that intending Airlines should submit their requests for \nchanges etc. of scheduled flight timings on a monthly basis only and such requests must reach \nthis office a fortnight in advance i.e. for changes w.e.f. 15th August 98, requests must reach \nby 1st of August 98 and so on. \n \n \n(J.P. VERMA) \nOFFICER ON SPECIAL DUTY (INT) \n \n(REF: NO.CAS-6  (10) / 98-DIV-I \nDated : 27.07.1998)"
