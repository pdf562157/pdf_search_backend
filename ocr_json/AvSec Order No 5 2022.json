However, on completion of a search,\nthe baggage should be closed and fastened but should not, under normal\ncircumstances, be returned to the passenger.\n\nii) _ Whenever possible, manual searchers should have ready access to X-\nray facilities and ETD/EVD equipment to support their examination of\nindividual items. The search should be carried out at a location specified in\napproved standard operating procedures. Preferably, the search should be\nconducted at a location not observable by other passengers, and in a secure\nand controlled environment.\n\nii) Manual search of the hold baggage should be conducted in\naccordance with the following basic guidelines:\n\na) the searcher should be tactful, courteous and use caution;\n\nb) __ it is important to adopt a systematic approach so that no items or\nareas of the bag are overlooked;\n\nc) baggage must be matched with the correct person/owner and\npositioned on the search table so that the owner can open the bag, but not\ninterfere with the conduct of the search;\n\nd) items found in baggage that could conceal a prohibited article should\nbe opened or subjected to screening by X-ray or other explosive detection\nequipment.\n\niv) Manual search of hold baggage should preferably be conducted by\nsame gender especially in case of female passenger.\n\n7.2 Explosive trace/vapour detection equipment checks: ETD/EVD\nequipment to be used shall be specified by BCAS, It shall be used as part of\nboth primary and secondary (alarm resolution) processes.

In particular, but not exclusively, the\noperator should look for the components of an IED, including detonators,\nwires, batteries, and electronic or mechanical timing devices. Particular\nattention should be given to dense or opaque areas that might conceal\nrestricted articles and areas highlighted by the system as potential locations\nfor a threatening item;\n\nii) check that the shading of a baggage image is consistent throughout,\nsince lighter edges may indicate the presence of a sheet explosive that does\nnot completely line the top or bottom of the baggage;\n\niii) pay as much attention to the baggage framework and appendages as\nto its contents; and\n\niv) examine any metallic or channelled part of baggage for apparent\nbulges or protrusions which could partially conceal a component of an\nexplosive device.\n\n7.4 If the X-ray operator is not fully satisfied that the baggage and its\ncontents do not contain any restricted articles or components of restricted\narticles, the baggage shall undergo further examination. Under no\ncircumstances, the screener shall clear the baggage until he is fully satisfied\nthat it does not contain any restricted item/article.\n\n7.5 Selection of hold baggage for manual search by X-ray operator should\nalways be made using the principle of reasoned selection and in a consistent\nmanner throughout the period hold baggage is being processed. Reasoned\nselection means that the selection is based on the X-ray image,\nconcentrating the effort on those bags most likely to conceal a\nprohibited /dangerous item and artfully concealed weapons/IED.\n\n7.6 Hold baggage that cannot be cleared by the X-ray screening process\nshall be referred for manual hand search and explosive detection test. Any\nhold baggage which cannot be satisfactorily cleared by the total screening\nprocess shall be denied loading into the aircraft.\n\n7.7 It is imperative that the screening of baggage shall not cease when an\nunauthorized single weapon or device is detected since multiple weapons,\ndevices or dangerous items can be present in a hold-baggage.

The benefit of this\nprocedure is to positively identify hold baggage that is not properly matched\nwith a passenger or crew member on the specific flight, and to positively\nidentify any passenger who has not boarded the aircraft as well as his or her\nassociated hold baggage. The hold baggage shall not be placed on board an\naircraft unless:\n\n20.1.1 the hold baggage is properly marked externally to permit\nreconciliation with the relevant passenger or crew member;\n\n20.1.2 the passenger or crew member to whom the baggage belongs\nhas checked in for the flight on which it is to be carried;\n\n20.1.3 prior to loading, the hold baggage is held in an area of the\nairport to which only authorized persons have access;\n\n20.1.4 the hold baggage has been identified as either accompanied or\nunaccompanied;\n\n20.1.5 the hold baggage has been cleared by screener with due\nprocess.\n\nPage 19 of 32\n",
