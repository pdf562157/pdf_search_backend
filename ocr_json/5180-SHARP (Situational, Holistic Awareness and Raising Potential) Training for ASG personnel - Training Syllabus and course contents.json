It has been decided to name the training- SHARP (Situational,\nHolistic Awareness & Raising Potential). Iupaftial modification of earlier scheme, it has\nbeen decided that the Units should do away with the categorization of ASG personnel\ninto Very Good, Good & Average categories for imparting them 3,5,7 days inputs. This\nis done to avoid subjective stratification and demoralization amongst men and save on\nadministrative hassles. Instead each GD person may be impafted with the 7 days\ncapsule. Contents have already been identified, Unit Core Resource Personnel (CRP)\ntrained by the content makers on many subjects. Video of the content delivered in\nclassroom setting by content makers is also available for use by ASGs where suitable\nCRP on a subject is not available.\n3. \nThe non GD staff- Ministerial, Drivers, Tradesman will have 5 days training. 1st\nday content is common to both GD and non GD. Remaining 4 days are to be devoted\nto Specialized training inputs to refresh and upgrade their functional knowledge, skills,\nattitude. This has been painstakingly developed by content makers and must be used\nby ASG CRP.\n4. \nIn this regard, the broad topics to'be covered for this capsule training (7 days\nfor operational component and Day 01 for non-operational component) are enclosed\nherewith as per Appendix-\"A\" and the broad topics to be covered for Ministerial staff\n(Day 2 to 5) are enclosed herewith as per Appendix-\"B\". The applicability of training\nprograqtme work/trade profile/ content has been illustrated and given in Appendix-\n\"C\" for ready reference.\n5. \nThe resource personnel have already been identified by the ASGs for imparting\nthe above training. In addition to this,'DIsG/CASOs who have prepared the course\ncontents for the Topics of Syllabus have already briefed the resource",
  "2": "personneyqualified local instructors with the detailed course contents through video\nconference. Several content creators have also prepared a CD of real time class room\nsession on their assigned topics and shared it online for video guidance or its direct\nuse by ASGs lacking resource person on that topic.\n6. \nThe details of DIsG/CASOs and ACfAOs of the Zones/ASGs who have prepared\nthe course contents Topic-wise are also enclosed herewith as per Appendix-\"D\". In\ncase, the resource personnel (who will be imparting training) face any difficulty to\nunderstand any of the Topics, they may cgntact/consult the concerned DIG/CASO who\nhas actually prepared the course content for necessary clarification/guidance and being\nclear on the course intent.\n7. \nThe finally developed course contents on the 27 Topics of Syllabus along with\ncourse iyllabus/contents for Ministerial staff/Driversflradesmen and some of the Model\ntraining sessions have been uploaded on the Google drive.
