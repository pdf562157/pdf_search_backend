  "1": "CIRCULAR 21  / 2000 \n \n \nSUB: INSPECTION OF AIRPORTS BY BCAS OFFICERS- \nCOORDINATION WITH AIRPORT MANAGEMENT \n \n \nIt has been observed that the BCAS officers while conduction inspection at the \nairports do not associate the Airport Director / In charge Airport Management with the \ninspection at the airports.  This results in avoidable correspondence with AAI.  It has, \ntherefore, been decided that henceforth the BCAS officers will associate the Airport Director \n/ In charge Airport Management during inspection and point out deficiencies noticed on the \nspot for rectification as far as possible.  However, an inspecting officer shall continue to send \nthe report on inspection. \n \n \nThis issues with the approval of Commissioner of Security (CA) \n \n \n (P.MOHANAN) \nOfficer on Special Duty (I) \nfor Commissioner of Security (CA) \n \n \nNO.CAS-5 (11) / 90-I,  \nDated : 19.07.2000"
