Thus, lack of uniformity in implementation of contingency plans by the\nASG at any of the airports may reflect poorly on the operational capability and\nefficiency of CISF.\n3. \nBomb Threat Assessment Committee (BTAC) is a recognized apex body at the\nairports which has been empowered to evaluate every such call and take appropriate\naction as laid down in the Bomb Threat Contingency Plan (BTCP). BTAC categorizes\nthe received bomb threat / calls as'Specific' or 'Non-Speciflc'. CASOS of ASGS or his\nrepresentative and omcer I/C BDDS (wherever operationalized) are the members of\nthe BTAC and should play active role in deliberations during assessment of the threav\ncall by the Committee.\n4. \nThe broad guidelines on action to be taken in case of 'Speciflc' and 'Non-speciflc'\nthreat calls based on the Bomb Threat Contingency Plan issued by BCAS are hereby\nreiterated for strict adherence by all concerned:-\ni) \nAction in case of a Bomb Threat to an aircraft is evaluated by BTAC as\n'Non-Specific' is enclosed as per Appendix-'A'. It is clarified that if\nBTAC does not decide omoading of hold baggage from the aircraft, then\nCASOS of ASGS should not insist on offloading of the baggage from the\naircraft to avoid unnecessary delay in clearance of the flight.",
