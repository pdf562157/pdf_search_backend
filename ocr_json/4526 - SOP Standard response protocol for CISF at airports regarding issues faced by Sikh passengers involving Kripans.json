  "2": "Standard Operating Procedure\n\u00ae\n\nSub: Standard response protocol for CISF at airports regarding issues faced\nby Sikh passengers involving Kirpans\n\n1. Objective:\n\nThe objective of this SOP is to provide a standard procedure for the CISF\npersonnel at airports to handle issues faced by Sikh passengers wearing\nKirpans as religious articles of faith. This SOP aims to ensure that Sikh\npassengers\u2019 religious rights are respected while maintaining the highest\nstandards of security at the airport\n\n2. Scope:\n\nThis SOP is applicable to personnel involved in screening duties of fully\ndomestic flights. It covers the security screening process for Sikh passengers\nwearing Kirpans on person, including small Kirpans worn as necklaces or\nsouvenirs. It also aims to address the concerns of Sikh passengers regarding\nperceived racial profiling during security checks.\n\n3. Reference:\n\nBCAS AVSec Order No 11/2024 dated 30.10.2024 \u2014 Handling of\nProhibited Items\n\n\u201cPara 8 \u2014 Kirpan: Kirpan carried by Sikh passenger (Not permitted for staff\nof any entity), on person, in domestic routes of fully domestic flights operating\nfrom Domestic Terminals are allowed. However, blade of Kirpan should not\nexceed 15.24 cms (6 inches) and total length of the Kirpan should not exceed\n22.86 cms (9 inches)\u201d.\n\n4. General Guidelines:\n\n* The Sikh religion mandates that its followers, particularly initiated Sikhs carry\na Kirpan at all times as part of the Sikh articles of faith. While ensuring the\nhighest level of security at airports, it is essential that the religious sentiments\nand beliefs of Sikh passengers are respected and accommodated within the\nBCAS regulations.\n\n* Concerns have been raised regarding racial profiling, where Sikh\npassengers wearing small Kirpans as necklaces or souvenirs are subjected\nto additional scrutiny while passengers of other faiths wearing small Trishuls\nor Crosses are not similarly examined. In this reference, CISF personnel\nmust avoid any appearance of racial profiling and ensure that all religious\nsymbols are treated equally, with respect to security regulations.\n",
  "3": "\u00a9 Small Kirpans (1 inch or smaller) worn as necklaces or souvenirs must be\ndistinguished from Kirpans (permissible limit as specified by BCAS), which\nare typically allowed on fully domestic flights but restricted on international\nflights. The assessment should focus on the nature of the article (souvenir or\nreligious symbol), sharp edges, points. etc. and its potential to jeopardize\nthe safety and security of Civil Aviation.\n\n5. Protocol for Screening Sikh Passengers with Kirpans:\n\n* Upon encountering a Sikh passenger wearing a Kirpan, the CISF personnel\nshould recognize that the Kirpan is a religious article and not an item of\nconcern unless it violates security regulations.\n\n* The passenger must be politely informed that their Kirpan needs to be\nsubjected to additional checks to ascertain the regulations.\n\n* The duty personnel must verify that the small Kirpan (souvenir/necklaces)\ndoes not pose a security risk by checking for sharp edges, points. The focus\nshould be on whether the item is blunt, a replica, or a souvenir. If the duty\npersonnel is satisfied, the same should be allowed to carry. Common sense\nmust be applied in asserting whether an item can be used for committing an\nact of unlawful interference with civil aviation operations\n\n* Ifthe Kirpan exceeds the permissible size limit, the on-duty personnel should\npolitely apprise of the passenger about the relevant BCAS guidelines. Option\nshould be given to keep the Kirpan in the check-in baggage.\n\n* In case of dissuasion or non-cooperation by passenger, the matter should\nimmediately be referred to GO/SHA IC for further resolution\n\n6. Training of CISF Personnel:\n\n* The duty personnel should be regularly sensitized on religious practices,\nparticularly the significance of article of faith and differentiation between a\nsmall religious symbol and a prohibited item.\n\n* _ AIlASG personnel should be sensitized to handle such sensitive situations\nwith due respect, politeness and care. Passengers should be treated with\ndignity, avoiding any actions that could be perceived as disrespectful or\nconfrontational.\n\nThis document seeks to ensure a balanced approach for respecting the religious\n\nrights of passengers without compromising the aviation security standards in\naccordance with regulatory guidelines. The CISF personnel must always act\n\nwith respect, professionalism and sensitivity, ensuring a safe and inclusive\nenvironment for all passengers.\n\nSete\n"
