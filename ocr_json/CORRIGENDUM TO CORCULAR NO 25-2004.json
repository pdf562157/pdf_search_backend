INTRODUCTION\n1.1  Purpose of the Standard\nThe purpose of this document is to establish performance requirements and testing methods for\nactive walk-through metal detectors used to find metal weapons and/or metal contraband carried on a\nperson and/or concealed by a nonmetal object. \n1.2  Definitions\nThe definitions are provided to help the reader use and understand this document, which describes\nmethods for evaluating active walk-through metal detectors used as weapons detectors.  Terms that are\ndefined here appear in italics in the remainder of this document.\nAll measurement units used in this document are metric.  Length units are abbreviated:  meter (m),\ncentimeter (cm), and millimeter (mm).  Where useful, English units are indicated in parentheses\nimmediately following the metric units, such as \u201c2.54 cm (1 in).\u201d\n1.2.1  Alarm Indication\nA signal to warn of the detection of a metal object. The indication can be visual and/or auditory.  \n1.2.1.1  Positive Alarm Indication\nThe change in the alarm indication that corresponds to the detection of a metal object.  Typically,\nthe alarm indication is off until a metal object is detected.\n1.2.1.2  Proportional Alarm Indication\nAn alarm indication proportional to the size, proximity, orientation, and material of an object.",
  "11": "2\n1.2.2  Alarm Indicator\nThe device used to generate the alarm indication.  For a visual indication, the alarm generating\ndevice can be a light bulb, lamp, light emitting diode, etc.  For an auditory indication, the alarm\ngenerating device can be a horn, siren, buzzer, or similar item.\n1.2.3  Active Detector\nAn active detector is generally a device that generates energy for illuminating the portal region of\nthe detector.  For the walk-through metal detector, the generated energy is in the form of a magnetic\nfield.  The interaction of the generated magnetic field with certain types of objects in the portal region of\nthe detector and the ability to detect this interaction is the basis of operation for walk-through metal\ndetectors.\n1.2.4  Clean Tester\nA person who does not carry any electrically conductive and magnetizable objects such as metallic\nbelt buckles, metal buttons, cardiac pacemaker, coins, metal-frame eyeglasses, hearing aid, jewelry,\nkeys, pens and pencils, shoes with metal arches or supports, metallic surgical implants, undergarment\nsupport metal, metal zippers, and similar items, which would significantly alter the signal produced when\nthe person carries a test object.  \n1.2.5  Detection\nThe discovery or finding of a metallic object.  The detection of a metallic object is transmitted to the\noperator by some type of alarm indicator, typically a visual or audible indicator.\n1.2.6  Detector Axis\nAn imaginary line passing through and perpendicular to the detector plane that is centered\nvertically and horizontally within the portal of the walk-through metal detector and points in the direction\nof the subject\u2019s motion through the portal.

The\nstandards are based upon laboratory testing and evaluation of representative samples of each \nitem of equipment to determine the key attributes, develop test methods, and establish minimum\nperformance requirements for each essential attribute. In addition to the highly technical standards,\nOLES also produces technical reports and user guidelines that explain in nontechnical terms the\ncapabilities of available equipment.\nThe National Law Enforcement and Corrections Technology Center (NLECTC), operated by a\ngrantee, which supervises a national compliance testing program conducted by independent\nlaboratories. The standards developed by OLES serve as performance benchmarks against which\ncommercial equipment is measured. The facilities, personnel, and testing capabilities of the inde-\npendent laboratories are evaluated by OLES prior to testing each item of equipment, and OLES\nhelps the NLECTC staff review and analyze data. Test results are published in Equipment Per-\nformance Reports designed to help justice system procurement officials make informed \npurchasing decisions.\nPublications are available at no charge through the National Law Enforcement and Corrections\nTechnology Center. Some documents are also available online through the Internet/World Wide\nWeb.
