No part of this document may be disclosed to a person without a \u201cneed to know\u201d as defined in NCASP. \ni \n \n \nPREFACE \n \nThe safety, regularity, and efficiency of civil aviation and its facilities are increasingly \nthreatened by a variety of criminal acts. There is thus a need to take every possible measure \nto ensure the protection and safeguarding of passengers, flight crew, ground personnel, the \ngeneral public, and civil aviation facilities against acts of unlawful interference perpetrated \non the ground and in-flight. These measures should be customized, based on a risk \nassessment, to counter different levels of threat. \n \nThe International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), an agency of the United Nations, seeks \nto promote appropriate levels of aviation security throughout the global community. ICAO \npromulgates Standards and Recommended Practices (SARPs) in respect of civil aviation \nsecurity through Annex 17 of the Chicago Convention, 1944. Requirements of 12th edition of \nAnnex 17 are reflected in this document. \n \nIn addition, the United Nations Security Council met in September 2016 and adopted \nResolution 2309 (UNSCR 2309 (2016)), which affirmed States\u2019 responsibility to ensure the \nsafety of air services operating within their territory and called on all States to work within \nthe ICAO to ensure that international security standards were reviewed, updated, adapted, \nand put in place based on current risks, following the Chicago Convention on Aviation \nSecurity, as well as urging all States to ensure cooperation among their domestic \ndepartments, agencies, and other entities. \n \nThe Republic of India is a signatory to the Chicago Convention, and Annex 17 to the \nConvention contains a series of SARPs with which India is expected to comply. Specifically, \nAnnex 17 Standard 3.1.1 requires contracting states to: \n \n\u201cestablish and implement a written national civil aviation security programme to \nsafeguard civil aviation operations against acts of unlawful interference, through regulations, \npractices and procedures which take into account the safety, regularity and efficiency of \nflights.\u201d \n \nThe National Civil Aviation Security Programme (NCASP) of the Republic of India is revised \nby the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS) in 2024 in accordance with the current \n(twelfth) edition of Annex 17 dated November 18, 2022, amendment 18, which is applicable \nfrom 20th February 2024 along with guidance detailed in ICAO Document 8973, \u201cAviation \nSecurity Manual\u201d (Thirteenth Edition of 2022), and provides a degree of harmonisation with \ngood practises identified elsewhere in the global community. \n \nThis NCASP is volume 1 (VOL-1) of two volumes that form the national-level civil aviation \nsecurity programme of the Republic of India. Volume 2 (VOL-2) contains references to AVSEC \nOrders/Circulars referred in this document.  \n  \nThe National Civil Aviation Security Programme (NCASP) of the Republic of India has been \ndeveloped to support civil aviation entities. It outlines the policies and procedures to meet the \nelements of the civil aviation laws and to safeguard civil aviation operations against acts of \nunlawful interference. All agencies involved in civil aviation operations are to implement, \nadhere to, or be guided by, as appropriate, the provisions detailed in this national programme.",

In order to accomplish this, two levels of action should be \ndistinguished: \n \na. \nimprove the efficiency of the overall aviation security system (through policies, \nprocesses and procedures); and \n \nb. \nmatch the limitations and capabilities of the operators to the technologies. \n \n8.3.3.4. \nRegardless of the technology in place, the basic elements for effective operations \ninclude the selection of suitable personnel, provision of adequate training, design of the \nwork environment and rotation schedule to ensure optimal performance, and \nestablishment of motivating incentives. \n \n8.3.3.5. \nThe following are some Human Factors principles that are useful for improving \nthe efficiency of the overall aviation security system: \n \na) \nadapt the operator\u2019s level of qualification by a specific selection and training \nprocess; \nb) \ndesign of security control points; \nc) \nwork organization; \nd) \ndefine the tolerance of error; and \ne) \nanalyse the workstation and the work behaviour. \n \n*****",
