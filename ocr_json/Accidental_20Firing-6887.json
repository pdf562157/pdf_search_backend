AS 06/2010\n\nSubject :-Accidental firing at duty posts and inside Terminal Building at\nAirports : Req\n\nInstructions and guidelines have been issued time and again by the FHQr and Airport\nSector HQr to prevent incidents of accidental firings. Despite detailed guidelines and instructions,\ncases of accidental firing have not ceased and keep on happening. This only reflects lack of\nproper training of the men and lack of regular sensitization by the supervisory officers regarding\nproper handling of weapons and related Dos &-Don'ts and surprise inspections by the supervisory\nofficers at the duty posts.\n\n02. On reviewing the cases of accidental firing since Jan\u20192009, it has been noticed that 03\ncases out of total 14 have taken place inside the Airport terminal building. Similarly, 02 cases\nhave occurred on other duty posts (01 each-in SSG & GBS). All remaining cases have taken\nplace in the Kote during handing/taking over of Arms/Ammunitions. This is very alarming and can\nnot be allowed to continue. In this regard, it would be interesting to analyse the facts in a recent\ncase of accidental firing by a SSG personne! at the residence of CM of Manipur. \u201cThe said\nConstable confessed before the ADG that-he was (perhaps. out of fear of being posted in an\ninsurgency affected area) in the habit of charging the.chamber of AK-47 weapon on duty and also\nkeeping the locking mechanism in Repeat position\u201d... As can\u2018be seen, such decisions cannot be\ntaken by the personnel at their personal level. Had this Constable been checked including the\nstatus of his weapon at the duty post by the supervisory officers, perhaps the incident could have\nbeen avoided.\n\n03. You would appreciate that the terminal building is a highly vulnerable area and accidental\nfiring therein may result in loss of life/fatal injuries to the passengers and staff. Besides, these\nincidents in the terminal building also causes severe. embarrassment for the Force due to public\ndisplay of such unprofessional act which also invites avoidable public and media attention.\n\n04. - \u2018There is no dehyirig the fact that accidental firing while on duty would happen\u2019 only when\nthe personnel either fiddle with the arms unnecessarily or have not taken adequate safety\nprecautions while keeping the arms on the person. Such negligent tendencies among the\npersonnel deployed at duty posts especially inside the terminal building at airports is totally\nunacceptable.\n\nContd...P/2-\n",
  "10": "05. Hence, it is directed that the CASOs and other supervisory officers should continuously\nbrief and sensitize all the personnel of their units to refrain from such negligent acts which may\nlead to accidental firing. The briefing and sensitization of the personnel should be carried on as a\nregular exercise thorough out the year.\n\n06. _ It is also directed that any case of accidental firing at duty post, especially inside the\nterminal building would not only be a cause of disciplinary action and severe punishment for the\nerring personnel but would also attract action against the concerned supervisory officers including\nthe Unit Commanders/CASOs/shift GOs.\n\n07..

Despite detailed instructions and r\u00e9peated emphasis, there have been 6 cases of\naccidental firing in the year 2009 which is-01 more than 2008, The analysis of these cases reveal\nthat 4 out of the 6 cases have occurred in the Kote during the process of depositiwithdrawal of\nweapons and 2 of them have occurred at the duty post. All the four cases in the Kote reveal\nnegligent-handling of the weapon during the checking procedure at the time of issue/deposit of\narms/ammunitions. One of the two cases at the duty post also involves negligent handling of the\nweapon during the process of handing/taking over of arms/ammunitions.\n\n3. Due to negligence and non compliance of instructions regarding handing of weapons a\nserious incident of death of SI/EXE took place at-SSG Tatanagar on 03.02.2010. In this case the\nSI/Exe handed over his Glock service pistol to.one constable for cleaning without removing the\nloaded magazine. In order to open the Glock pistol the Constable pulled the slide back, then tried\nto remove the slide with his left hand simultaneously pressing the slide stopping lever with his\nright hand to detach the slide from the body. In this process the muzzle of the pistol was not\nmaintained in a safe direction and was pointing towards the SI/EXE. One of the right hand fingers\nof the Constable entered the trigger guard and pressed the trigger, resulting in the release of one\nbullet which hit the left temple of SI/EXE after piercing the left palm of Constable. SI/EXE was\nimmediately taken to hospital, where he succumbed to his injury. In the instant case Fire Arm\nSafety Precautions during the exchange/cleaning of weapon were not followed by both SIIEXE\nand Constable.\n\n4. The above statistics and analysis of the incidents clearly reflect violation of instructions of\nFHQr. and this HQrs. about handing/taking and issue and deposit of arms. The instructions\nunequivocally state that Officer In-charge of Kote must remain present at the time of issue and\nchecking of weapon by the personnel and that if a wrong procedure is being adopted, the same\nshould be pointed out and got corrected immediately... It was also instructed that handing/taking\nover of ams should always take place in the Kote and not at or near the place of duty. Moreover,\nall the prescribed safety measures should be followed during handing/taking over of weapons.\n",
