  "1": "CIRCULAR   26  / 2000 \n \n \nSub: DETECTION OF DANGEROUS GODDS AT LADDER POINT \n \n \n \nRecently few live cartridges and used rounds were detected by the airlines \nstaff in the ash-tray attached to the seat of an aircraft when they were doing routine anti \nsabotage check of the aircraft before the aircraft was cleared for the flight operation.  The \naircraft has just completed one flight and was being readied for a flight in different sector \nwhen the above items were noticed.  Ostensibly some one had successfully crossed two \nsecurity barriers one by the APSU and the other by Airlines Security at ladder point and \nmanaged to get the objectionable it in the aircraft. \n \n  \n \nThat such security lapses keep occurring is a source of serious \\concern especially \nsince the above incident has taken place so soon after the hijacking of IC-814 when the \nsecurity agencies ought to be on high alert.  The above matter was brought to the notice of \nHon\u2019ble Minister of Civil Aviation who expressed his displeasure over the incident.  He has \ndesired that the security agencies involved in implementing aviation security measurers \nshould tighten up their security measures and ensures that such lapses do not recur. \n \n \nAll the security personnel whether belonging to State Police, CISF or Airlines should \nundertake a review of their working and plug loopholes wherever existing in order to ensure \nthat security violations do not recur.  Monitoring and security Audit by Senior Officers \nshould be admired with the above objective. \n \n (VEERANNA AIVALLI) \n Commissioner of Security (CA) \n \n \nNO.CAS-3 (1) / 2000 /DIV-IIIB \nDated : 17.08.2000"
