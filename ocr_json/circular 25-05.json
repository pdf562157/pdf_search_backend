All photographic equipment and film should be x-ray screened. X-\nray baggage inspection system installed at Indian airports, both for \ncabin as well as checked baggage, will not affect images captured \nby a digital camera. In addition, it will also not affect films that have \nalready been processed, slides, videos, photo compact discs or \npicture discs. \n \n2. However, if a passenger requests for hand-inspection of an \nundeveloped, high speed and specialty film, the screener may \ninspect the same by hand. For this, the screener should ask the \npassenger to remove the undeveloped film from the canister for \nmanual examination.  The screener must satisfy himself about \ngenuineness of the film before clearing it for carriage on board the \naircraft. \n \n3. Airlines should encourage passengers to remove undeveloped \nfilm from canister and pack it in a clear plastic bag to facilitate its \nhand-inspection at the security check point. Further, to avoid \nconcerns that the undeveloped film may be damaged by X-ray BIS, \nthe airlines should also advise passengers that they should get their \nfilms processed locally before passing through airport security on \nreturn trip. \n \n \n(R.C.
