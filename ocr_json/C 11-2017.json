INTRODUCTION\nThe existing X-ray machines\ninstalled at check in area in some of the airports to screen\nregistered baggage are in stand-alone\nmode and not capable of detecting\n100% explosives.\nStand-alone machines occupy space at departure lounges and also cause big queues, which\ndisrupt passenger flow during peak hours. Keeping in view the security threat\nit is desirable\nthat multi-level\nCT-EDS\nbased in-line detection system is installed at major airports. The\nInline hold baggage handling system (HBS) shall be integrated with airport baggage handling\nsystem in order to provide complete hold baggage processing and screening system All new\nterminals and airports constructed in future will have only HBS. The priority of installation of\nHBS shall be decided by Airport Operator in consultation with BCAS.\n2. Conceptual\nSystem Design\nThe system designed for multi-level screening process shall have the following features: -\n2.1 Levell\nLevel\nscreening\nis to be undertaken\nby a CT-EDS\nmachine\nwith\nautomatic\nexplosives detection facilities. All baggage images will be referred to Level 2 with suspicious\narea highlighted, if any, where a certified screener will accept or reject the baggage.\n2.2\nLevel2\n2.2.1 Level 2 screening is remote workstations(s)\nwhereby operator(s) can analyze the image\ngenerated by the Levell\nCT-EDS machine. The workstation is required to be equipped with\nenhanced imaging / manipulation systems to assist operator to diagnose the screened image.\n2.2.2 100% of level-l screened baggage images should be referred to level 2.\n2.2.3 Whilst the bag is being referred to level 2, it should be 'tracked'\nwhile it travels along\nthe length of the conveyor such that its position and identity is known at all times.\n2.2.4\nIn practice, it is usual to provide a conveying system that allows a programmable time\nof ur to 30 seconds to queue and process the level 2 images.\n2.2.5\nIn case of major airports with 5 MPPA or more, airport operators shall install level 2 B\nso as to ensure that Level-3 is not overloaded.\nIn case of bigger airports (higher passenger\ndensity airport),\na workstation\n2B shall be introduced\nfor longer time analysis.\nIn this\ninstance, there will be enhanced\nimage manipulation\ncapabilities;\nusually a more senior /\nexperienced operator will view the image and have more time to interpret and take a decision.\n2.2.6 In systems with multiple level 1 machines, the MUX / Matrix type set-up of several\n. levelland\nlevel 2 workstations\nwill be linked together, enabling the next un-cleared level 1\nimage to go to next available\nlevel-2 workstation.\nThe MUX / matrix data communication\nRESTRICTED\nPage 10 of 26",

These workstations may increase as per requirement and higher density airports.\n2.3.3\nThese workstations\nshould be able to pull the image of the baggage created by Level-l\nmachine by a barcode reader/ scanner.\n2.3.4\nA standalone Dual Energy and dual view X-BIS shall be installed at Level-3 to screen\nthe baggage again. Screener shall rescreen the baggage at level-3 invariably.\n2.3.5\nExplosive Trace / Particle detection Check. The un-cleared / suspected bags shall be\nchecked with latest explosive trace detectors by using vacuum pump / specially designed filter\npapers for checking the presence of explosive substances.\n2.3.6\nExplosive Sniffer Dogs.\nThe dogs being the most reliable explosive detection system,\nit is recommended that rejected bag at level 3 be sniffed by Explosive Detection dogs. A dog\nshall be deployed for confirmation,\nonce ETD gives a positive signal. The dog is to be turned\nover everyone\nhour. In an 8-hour shift, there should be minimum 2 dogs with handlers.\n2.4 Level 4\n2.4.1\nAll un-cleared\n/ suspected\nbags at level 3 are to be reunited with their owners for\nfurther inspection and interview. This process is normally manual and should be done in a safe\narea.\n2.4.2\nA workstation may be installed at level-4 to retrieve the image created by Level--l CT-\nEDS to facilitate the physical inspection of the baggage by the security staff. Bag should be\naccepted or rejected on the system as well as an entry in the baggage hand over register is to be\nmade.\n2.4.3\nThese workstations\nshould be able to pull the image of the baggage created by Level-l\nmachine by a barcode reader/ scanner.\n2.4.3 Any bag that is still deemed to be suspect after passenger interview. or if the passenger\nRESTRICTED\nPage 11 of 26",

This procedure is repeated\nuntil all bags in a single transaction are released in to the system.\n30.4\nIt is preferential\nto arrange the conveyor speed such that the bags are fired across the\ncollector conveyor.

Also the correct pitch of baggage entering the machine is important.\nFor ,:ownstream controls to be able to singulate and pitch baggage into the machine correctly\neach item must be separate and there must be a detectable gap between successive items --an\nautomated baggage separation mechanism is required to achieve this.\n32.3\nClassically, there are 4 potential baggage patterns that can cause problems and hence\nshould be detected and resolved via baggage separation i.e.\nI. Bags caught up with each other, nose to tail, no overlap\nII. Bags partially overlapped, left hand bag leading\nIII. Bags partially overlapped, right hand bag leading\nIV. Bags fully overlapped, i.e. side by side.\n32.4\nFirstly, a series of sensors are required to detect the above sequence. Secondly, a series\nof queue conveyors, usually with inverter speed control and differing belt types are required.\nBy varying the speed differential between them it is possible to separate baggage in the first 3\nsequences above.\n32.5 If it is likely that bags can be fully overlapped,\nthen these bags can normally only be\nseparated if they are transferred\nthrough at 45 degree Y-junction\nsuch that they naturally\nbecome one of the first 3 sequences instead. In this case, 2 bag separation systems are to be\nprovided, before and after the 90-degree junction.\nThese are normally termed 'primary'\nand\n'secondary'\nbaggage separation systems, but are functionally similar.\n33.\nOver- Height Detection.\n33.1\nAn over - height detector is required on a queue conveyor prior to the X-ray machine,\nmainly to prevent damage to the machine and the bag. Ideally this should be a mechanical flap\nwith limit switch as these are not too sensitive to straps and labels etc. The use of photocells\nfor this is not so efficient.\n33.2\nIf the limit switch on the over height detector trips, then the bag is transported onto the\nnext queue conveyor and stopped.\n33.3\nThe oversized bag can now be removed or re-oriented.\nA visual warning beacon will\nflash and an audible alarm will pulse to alert the screening\nstaff.

This ideally needs to be up to 30 seconds for the\nlevel 2A. Another 40-110 seconds are available to level 2B for a decision to be made. The\nLevel 2 decision should be made by the time the bag reaches the decision point, which is\nusually some form of diverting\nmechanism.\nIf the operator does not make a decision. the\nsystem will automatically default the bag to the Level 3 screening areas for further analysis.\n35.1.4\nThe diverting mechanism will allow cleared bags to proceed to the makeup area and\nroute suspect bags to the level 3 area for further inspection.\n35.1.5\nCleared level 3 bags shall enter into the system after the screening process through a\nconveyor belt.\n35.1.6\nSuspect bags at this point are referred to Level 4, for passenger-baggage\nreunion.\n35.1.7\nCleared level 4 bags are usually entered into the system after the screening process.\nThis can either be a manual or automated process.\n35.1.8\nTracking errors are a function of both the mechanical system solution. and also the\nsoftware and commissioning\nprocess.

Careful selection of a diverter type for out sorting to level 3 area\n35.2\nTracking Error Rates\n35.2.1 The target\nrate for correct\ntracking\nis 99%. Tracking\nerrors\nare defined\nas the\npercentage of all bags that are routed to level 3 because tracking information is lost such that it\nis no longer possible to securely associate the bag screening decision with the bag. In such\ncases the bag is routed to level 3 as a fail-safe measure.\nThis error rate does not make\nprovision for any bags to reach the makeup area that have not been specifically cleared by the\nscreening process. The achievement of this must be 100%.\n35.2.2\nThere is however some tracking error causes that are out of the control of the system\nand these mainly pertain to baggage types. The following examples are intended to illustrate\ntypes of baggage induced tracking errors.\n35.2.3 Tracking errors result from apparent changes in length or position with respect to the\nconveyor belt, outside the defined tolerances as detected by photocells\nand pulse generators\nplaced on the tracking conveyors.\n35.2.4 This is an easily understood way of explaining how baggage characteristics\ncan cause\nmovement with respect to the belt, resulting in a tracking error. In this example bag 1 that\nstands on a conveyor on its wheels is likely to move with respect to the belt and thus change\nits position with respect to the belt. The other bag 2 indicates the possibility of its progress\nbeing interfered with by a protrusion such as a wheel holding the joint between conveyors: this\nwould also move the position of the bag with respect to the belt and cause a tracking error\n35.3\nLength Change\nThe above example illustrate a way in which the length of a bag and the position of the\nbag can appear to change from the perspective of the photocells that detect the baggage\n36.\nBaggage position tracking\n36.1 The purpose of baggage tracking is to accurately reconcile routing decisions made by\nPLC control systems to real baggage travelling upon the conveyors.\nThe software solution\nmust provide fail - safe software philosophies for tracking baggage and routine actions whilst\nalso being\nsomewhat\ntolerant\nof the unpredictable\ntravel\ncharacteristics\ninherent\nwhen\nconveying variable baggage types.\n36.2\nThe bag position tracking technique shall be used for tracking bags on the conveyor\nwith data attached to them inside the PLC System.\n36.3\nEach tracking conveyor\nis fitted with a pulse generator on a non-driven\nroller. The\npulse generators generate a pulse per unit of the belt movement on the conveyor.\nRESTRICTED\nPage 24 of 26",
  "25": "RESTRICTED\n36.4\nWhen a bag breaks the photocell on the first conveyor, which enters the bag into the\ntracking model, the bags unique PLC allocated tag is entered into a PLC register. This happens\nwhilst the bag is obscuring the photocell. Thus a series of registers are created at the resolution\nof the pulse generator,\nwhich create a virtual image of the bag. The pulses received from\nrespective conveyor causes the registers containing the bag tag to be moved. As such through\nthese each tracking conveyor a bag is mapped to its own dedicated set of registers and the bag\ncan be seen moving as the conveyor moves.\n36.5\nThis technique allows the bag position to be monitored to the resolution of the pulse\ngenerator that would typically be 50 mm. Thus when the bag reaches the next photocell on the\nnext conveyor its tracked image should also reach the photocell within a tolerance. This allows\nthe tracking of the bag based on its position and is thus tolerant of bags being removed without\ncausing a serial error to all succeeding bags.\n36.6 In high security applications the registered image also provides a length measurement of\nthe bag to the resolution of the pulse generator. This can be used in addition to the positional\ncheck to give some ability to detect a bag being replaced with a different bag but of a different\nlength within tolerances.\n36.7\nThis technique gives rise to a degree of certainty of the bag currently at the photocell\nbeing the proper bag to which the data in the PLC relates. This level of certainty is determined\nby the tolerances. A bag that has moved with respect to the belt out side of the set tolerance\nbut which is not within the tolerance of another bag is uncertain as to which bag it is.\n36.8\nA similar concept applies where length check is also used where the position is within\ntolerance but the length has changed outside of tolerance. When a bag becomes uncertain in\nthis way it is termed as a miss track. Bags that are miss-tracked are handled according to a set\ndefault destination for miss-tracked bags.\n36.9 This form of tracking control is to be utilized in the security element i.e. the 100% HBS.\n37.\nBlockage Detection\n37.1\nConveyor belt is required to be fitted with a photocell at its discharge end.

With broad tolerances\napplied to checking routines within the software, the\nsystem\ncan\nbecome\nvery\ntolerant\nof\nthe\nconveying\ninaccuracies.\nHowever,\nanother\nfundamental feature of HBS control systems should be to identify (if possible), tampering with\nor exchanges of baggage. This feature requires the application of tight checking tolerances.\n38.3 Thus, the situation\nexists where tighter the tolerances\nare made to satisfy 'security'\nrequirements greater will be the volume of bags rejected as 'miss-tracks',\nconversely, opening\nup the tolerances will reduce reject rates but will reduce the level of security offered. BHS\nefficiency is defined in terms of acceptable levels of miss-tracks and miss-directs. In general,\nthe target for this should be in the order of 1 - 2 %.\n********\nRESTRICTED\nPage 26 of 26"
