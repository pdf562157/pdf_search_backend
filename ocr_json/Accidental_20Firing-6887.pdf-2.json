In spite of above instructions and\n\nguidelines, reports of 20 cases of accidental firing have already been received by this\nHrs by the\u2019end of June 2005. : 7\n\nExpressing his concern during the Staff meeting held-on 276-2005, Director\n- General observed that this shows carelessness while handling of weapons and also\nlack of regular raining at unit. level, Besides this also speaks of loos\u00e9 command and\n\ncontrol of the unit. DG further stressed that mishandling of weapons is a Very serious *\n\nlapse and stringent disciplinary action should be taken against such erring personnel,\n\nIn this regard it may.be reiterated that we have already forwarded a Committee\nreport on causes and remedial measures on Accidental firings to all our formations vide\nour letter of even No. (1184) dated 6th August 2003. The salient features of the report\n\nreveal the following: -\n\n1, Lack of Unit Level Training:\n\nLack of Training\u2019has \u2018always been slated:to be one of the main reasons for\naccidental firing,. But this inadequacy in training starts-after a person goes to his Unit\n\u201cafler Basic. Training. ' In'the Basic Training a person is given intensive-exposure on\n. Weapons and it can be safely concluded that there is no inadequacy at that stage.\nHowever, once he goes to the Unil for actual deployment, there is a.sleep drop in his\nlevel of knowledge and skills including that on weapons, simply because there is hardly\nany unit Jevel training worth its name. Aiso because a large number of duly points have\nunarmed guards, 4 person does not get to-Handlo weapons for a long period, \u2018Dua to\nlack of training and unarmed. duti\u00e9s, for-a iong:period familiarity of a person with his\nWeapon goes down, thereby, very badly affecting his skills as well as confidence,\nWhen such a person handles a weapon during his duty, after a considerable lag of time,\nthe levels of his confidence and skill are low which may lead to accidental firing.\n\u00bb Sudden exigencies like confronting an armed intruder (especially in Naxal/ciime prone\nareas) further exacerbat\u00e9 such incidents because the reflexes do not match the\nrequired skill levels on the weapori leading to accidental firing,\n\nContd..2/-\n\n",
  "2": "Skill of a person on handling of weapons can\u2019 be compared with his ting uty,\ncycling skills. A trained driver or cyclist may nol forget driving of cy cling.

Iv other words, it is momentary loss of concentration or absent\nPndednass, which makes the person to conmiil small-mistakos leading to accidental\nfiring, In most cases such a person forgets to remove the magazine before cocking the\nfille. If the magazine is loaded and trigyer is pressed round gels fired. In most cases\nof the accidental firing, this is how it|happens: This inability of a person to follow the\nsaquence is, many times, due lo \u201cmomentary tack of concentration\" or \u201cmomentary\nabsent-mindedness\" These points get furllier strengthened when we notice thal\nPersons managed to fire accidentally even {rom revolver and bolt action rifle, which are\nthe safest weapons. .\n\n3. Non-adherence to Jaid-down procedure ; Normally, the inspection of weapons at\nthe time of withdrawal and depositing should be dong in a group and as a drill under the\nsupervision of a sub-officer \u00ab There are very wall faid down practicesidritls for,inspecting\na weapon ~ loading & unloading, while depositing in the kote or handiniy over to some\nother person. Thus It.isi viewed that there cat not be an accidental firing if theso drills\nwhich are very simple and hardly take a mimito or two, are followed. But, as it happens\nin So many other things, some titnes most sim.te and Unainbiquous instructions are not\nfollowed All the units theref\u00e9re should have sich standing instructions \u201co the olfect thal\nthe issue and deposil of weapons shouid be done under the supervision uf a suly-offiver\nThe Inspection or loading or unloading drill should mal be done individually leaving a\nscope for accidental firing to happen. .\n\n4. Intoxication : Although it is not strongly brotight oul in the COls conducted for the\naccidental firing cases, \u2018but influence of intoxicating substances is also one-\u2018of the\nfeasons for a few of the accidental firings. A person becomes bolder at the first stage\nafter taild intoxication aid may uso a weapon more carelessly. Al the second stage of,\nintoxication, he may lose concentration, which may\u2019again lead to accidental firing. A.\nparson deeply intoxicated is incapable of concentration and may alter the sequence of\nactions while handling the weapon. Intoxication is not limited to the use of drinks only,\nIn many cages persons use intoxicating substances like ganja, bhang, opium etc. Itis\nvery difficult to identify such: people and remove them from duly. Therefore identification\nof such personnel by regimental intelligence and action to isolate such personnal is very\nnecessary,\n\n5. Fatigue; \u2018Fatigue can also be one of the reasons which may lead to accidental firing\nCISF \u2018is @ need-based force where the personnel are deployed strictly as per. the\nrequirement of duty point leaving just adequate reserve lo take.care of leave, weekly-ol!\nand ex-unil engagements like training, etc. However, when large number of personnel is:\nwithdrawn for duties \u2018ike Internal seourty, parades, election duties ete. the remainin:;\npersonnel put in . .\n\nContd..2/-\n\n",

Being caught in stressful thoughts, such persons can fire accidentally. .\n\nOvercontidence is another aspect which may lead to a certain level\nof casualriess in handing of weapons and thus accidental firing. Instances have occurred\nwhere personnel who have been well trained in handling of weapons and have also been\nin'th\u00e9\u2019process of cntinuous practice have fired accidentally. A glaring example amongst\nthes\u00e9\"is the inciderit of accidental firing that occurred at the residence of the Chiof\nMinister of Gujarat.\" In this case the erring Constable was of 2000 batch and after\ncompletion of his Basic Training had also undergone the very strenuous,VIP Securily\nCourse at RTC\u2019 Deoli, Also he had further undergone a refresher course at SRTE\nGhaziabad before his eventual deployment.at Gandhinagar.

The inspecting officers should also make it a paint\n(o assess the level of knowledge and skills of the unil personnel on weapons and make a\nspecial mention of this in their inspection reports, Needless to say thal in addition to\ninstructors, unit commander and other\u2019 officers as well as the inspecting officers would\nalso have to have adequate knowledge of weapons to \u2018enable thei fo supervise the\n\n* training or comment on it; as the case may be. There may be a problem of non\navailability of personnel for training because of vacancies and or extra deployment.\nDeployment in 4-hour shifts may also cause this problem. This problem -should be\naddressed and examined thoroughly and instructions issued accordingly.\n\n(2) Strict adherence to faid dovin drill : Clear \u2018andl unambiguous instructions layin\ndown drills/procedures for issue and deposit of arms from / to kote and handing / taking\nover of the weapons at dilly poirils should be issued, As far as exchange of arnis al the\nKole is concemed, this mustibe done under the supervision of a sub-olfiger.or. a senior\nHC (if sub-sificer is not dvailable) who is.well versed with weapon handling, The SO /\n\u00bb HC, as;the case may be, should fallin; the, group, have the weapons-inspected by\n\u00bb following the laid down drill; with proper words of command, get them loadedd/-unloaded,\nas the case may be and then only dispose them for their duly points / barracks, \u201cWith\nregard to handing / taking over of the weapons al the duly points, the committee opines\nthat this should be avoided as far-as possible, \u201cBul wo also know that there: ard some\nplaces where such handing / taking ovar is. pable. However, at these places also\nsuch exchange of arms should be done under sirict supervision of a SO / SrlAC, as the\ncase may be, who\u2019along with. the relieving personnel should move from point to point, get\nthe weapons exchanged under his supervision at various points and go back with the\nrolieved staff. It is, however, pertinent-to menjion,here thal mere issue of instructions will\nnot suffite, {is in fact the easier part of the problem. The actual.problem lies in getting\nthe instructions implemented in folo, and that is where tho role of supervisory officers\n\ncomes in. a wa :\n\n(3 ) Haste on the part of persomnel_:_As far as haste on the part of personnel to get\nback-to their barracks/quarters is concerned, the same can be taken care of by insisting\nthat everybody attends the handing-taking: over drill and briefing & de-briefing sessions,\nno matter whether his weapon is cleaned or not oo :\n\n(4) Compulsory supervigion of lower / middle fevel leadership: _ thas beon seen\nthat lower / middle level leadership is rather week in CISI.

Obviously, a number of acts of omission / commission which\nAmount to indis\u00e9ipline get ignored.

This coupled with\nimaction by other supervisory officers of the unit a siluation eme-ges where sinaller\nwilringements or violations tend to go to the extremities. The situation, apart from leading\n\nlo olher indiscipline activities can also cause accidental firing by a person. We have to\ntherefore strengthen supervision at this level and create ways and means to check\nviolations at the very first instance\n\n(5) Provision of Posters: - Posters depicting the correct methods of handling of weapons\nmay be provided at appropriate places including Kote, Mess, Canteen, Recreation Hall,\nBarracks etc., where they are able to view it\u2019 on\u2019a continuous basis. This may help in\nreminding them of the procedures to be adopted and also rectify themselves if they are\nmaking any mistake.\n\n(8) Audio-Visual messages :_ Smail and compact messages over the public address\nsystem at regular intervals about the do's and dont's, while handling weapons may go a\nong way in imbibing correct usage of weapons amongst the personnel. Similarly, small\nvisual messages (clips) before the start of a film and during interval of a film, in recreation\nhalls of the unit may'also be advantageous for this said purpose.\n\n(7) Court of Enguiry ;- The court of enquiries that are normally conducted to find out\nthe cause of accidental firing is done in a routine manner with the result that the actual\ncause of the accidental firing is not brought out\u201d Rather, in most of the cases, the court\ngenerally inclines to conceal the administrative weakness of the unit, which might have\nbeen partly responsible for the incident. .\n\nt\n\nHence, it is felt that court of enquiries if carried out in an investigative manner can\nbring out the real cause of such accidents and thus go a long way in preventing such\nincidents in future.\n\nch sign_and_qreater interaction with men: The supervisory\nfunctionaries should be sensitized to the fact that stress and fatigue c.1n lead to so many\nProblems including indiscipline and accidental firing. They should, therefore, increase\ntheir level of frequency of interaction with their subordinates and ensure that stress and\nfatigue are not caused due {o avoidable reasons. It should also be ensured that violation\nof instructions, however small or insignificant, is strictly arid appropriately dealt with.\n\n(9) Checking regarding intoxication: The. unit commanders should ensure that a\nperson is not under the influence of any intoxicating substance before he mounts the\nduly. It must also be ensured that during {he duly hours also he does not consume such\n\u2018substance. Known and habitual individuals indulging in consuming alcohol, opium, ganj\netc. should be kept under close watch,\n\nIn view of above, ali Unit Commanders are directed to ensure that the above\nremedial measures / instructions are maintained in the Unit under their close\nsupervision so thal occurrence of accidental firing can be checked,\n\naap\n\nLen (Ajeet Singh snokhiwht )\nInspector General/Adm\n\n",
