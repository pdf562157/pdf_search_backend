All such rules and regulations are\nframed encompassing the passengers, Aviation security and safety aspects'\nDGCA is responsible for overall safety of the aviation industry. It frames rules\nregarding carriage of goods in the hold of the aircrafts. It also regulates the\ntransportation of dangerous goods by air. DGCA deals with the safety aspects of civil\naviation and is not directly concerned with the procedures related to the security\nchecks of the passengers.\nBCAS regulates the aviation security through AVSEC orders and Circulars which are\ninvariably implemented on ground by ASGs, Airlines and Airport Operators. All the\nguidelines related to security check procedures which include- anti-sabotage, anti-\nhijacking, access control measures etc. are circulated by the BCAS.\nRecently, BCAS has circulated guidelines regarding Staldard operating Procedures\nfor screening of the persons with special needs, individual with disabilities and\nindividual with reduced mobility vide AVSEC circular no oll2022. while drafting the\ncircular, it was the major concern of the BCAS that air travel sometimes,is a painful\nexperience for such type of passengers because of the long queues, multiple security\nprocedures, flight deiays, lost luggage etc,.It can be even more grueiling for people\nwith multiple challenges in their life. BCAS has also issued the guidelines for all\nAirport operators to make special arrangements to facilitate screening of such\npersons in a suitable enclosed space.\nIn order to implement the AVSEC Circular no. 07 12022 in letter in spirit, the\nASG/APSU personnel should be tactful and courteous while screening the passengers\nwith special needs. clSF / ASG is bound to assist such passengers through the\nscreening process. A1so, while following the security check procedure, courtesy and\nattention to privacy and dignity of the passenger needs to be invariably maintained by\nthe screeners / searchers ofthe ASG.\n1",

These passengers not only require\nspecial care but also want to maintain their dignity which is somehow affected by our\nScreening Staff during the PESC. While on one hand, BCAS has made thorough\nchecking of such passengers essential, ASG has to maintain due courtesy and pay\nattention to the privacy and clignity of such passengers on the other hand' this\nsometimes become contradictory as our personnel fail to maintain balance between\nthet\\^,o.WhilethejobassignedtoClsFatAirportsisofparamountimportance,this\nhumanitarian aspect cannot be overlooked by our men on duty. In this document,\nvarious aspects of the Screening of Passengers with special needs are discussed along\nwith an effective solution of the problem to make our ASGs more competent to tackle\nthese cases in a prolessional way. CISF (ASG) led by the ADG, Airport Sector, has\ntaken a lead in identifying the problem so as to ensure policy level, structural as well\nas operational levei intervention to minimize the complaints of PWDs and make the air\ntravel a wonderful experience for them.\nApart from PRM passengers, for whom regulatory guidelines have been issued which\nmandates special attention for them, however, there are some other class of\npassengers for whom any civitized society demands special attention at airport which\nincludes: Senior Citizens, Differently Abled persons, First time fliers, Illiterate persons,\npregnant ladies, Ladies with infants etc. In order to deal with such passengers with\nempathy, some revolutionary changes in the approach of ASGs is required. Since the\ntemperament and understanding 1eve1 of al1 the CISF/ASG personnel are not equal\nancl even after repeated instructions/ training some confusion exists among them, a\nviable solution of this problem is the need of the hour and the solution lies in the\ndeployment of a dedicated team of screeners/ non-screeners who can providr: selfless\nserviccs with humane approach - right from Departure Ramp to Boarding Gates.\nAccordingly, the idea of Swarnim Sewa has been conceptu alized to provide a pleasant\ntravelling experience to the special class of passengers without compromising any\nsecurity protocols of Aviation sector. The concept is discussed in details in the\nfollowing chapters of this document.",

This communication barriers need to be torn\ndown because it inculcates the feeling of being ignored'\nc. Feeling of being incompetent - Disabled people need more time to do a particular\nwork than other normal people. The disability barriers stop them from performing\nbasic tasks with ease with a feeling of being incompetent. only because of this\nincompetency, these people have to spend more time in preparation of their air\njourney if compared with common passengers. The same problem is also faced by\nother needy passengers due to age, lack of knowledge, temporary incompetency etc.\nd. Teased and abused - often people find satisfaction and lind superiority in bullying\nthe weak and underprivileged.

The possibiiity of \"concealment\" of any\nprohibited item inside the prosthetic limbs or other such supports cannot be ruled\nout. There are several instances worldwide when these prosthetic limbs are caught by\nsecurity agencies while smuggling prohibited items / narcotics / drugs etc'\nThe miscreants do not have any ethical / moral va-iues and they will utilize each and\nevery chance to hoodwink the security forces, and Prosthetic limbs provide enough\nopportunities for them.\nwhile security of the Airport is Paramount, no risk can be takenon part of ASG. It\nmeans, the security needs of the Aviation industry shouid be fulfilled without hurting\nsentiments of the passenger.\nIn this way, two types of threat are directly associated with PWDs :-\ni) \nAviation Security threat and\nii) \nThreat regarding outrage on social media which involves worldwide\ntarnishing of the image of the country as weli as CISF'\nTherefore, from the security point of view:-\ni) ASG cannot afford any leniency while carrying out the pre-embarkation security\nchecks hence,no relaxation during security check can be given to such\npassengers.\nii) Humane approach is required to be adopted while dealing with such passengers\nso that they cooperate fully with the ASGs.\nFor this, the ASG has to provide assurance to such passengers that they will be\ntreated at par with common passengers and their dignity will be unharmed.

In recent times,\nthe number of passengers with permanent reduce mobility is increasing along with\npassengers who are having temporary reduced mobility due to some medical\nconditions.\nSecurity norms for all type of passenger are same and it has been lollowed by ASG in\nletter and spirit. PRM passengers having mental agony due to their disability when\nare subjected to cumbersome processes of air travel along with strict security check\nsometime feel victimized. However, at the other end ASG personnel who is deployed\nfor securlty check has to follow security protocols. In case of PRM passenger, the\nsecurity check is quite sensitive as other equipment like walking aid or some type of\nother medical aid is also associated with them. Their inability to move or stand at\nsecurity checkpoint like common passenger also adds in their misery and this leads\nto more time in security check by ASG personnel which adds in their frustration.\nSometimes ASG personnel also get irritated by the inability of PRM passenger which\nleads to argument. ln the absence oI conducive / favourable condition PRM passenger",

SWARNIM SEWA : Making Perfect balance\nAs per AVSEC circular no ol 12022, improvement in the air travel screening process\nrequires that all persons, regardless of their personal needs and situations, are\ntreated with dignity, respect and courtesy. Recent times have witnessed a drastic\ntransformation in the passenger profile in the Aviation sector. Some of the passengers\nrequire special assistance at the Airports to comply with the complicated Air Travel\nnorms. Apart from PRM passengers, there are some other class of passengers who\nrequire special attention at airport i.e.senior Citizens, Diflerently Abled persons, First\ntime fliers, Illiterate persons, Pregnant ladies, Ladies with inlants etc.\nNow, the need for making a perfect balance between the two: - i) thorough security\nchecks of the passengers with special needs and ii) reduction of the passenger\ncomplaints / outrage on social media was felt, because of which, the concept of\nSwarnim Sewa evolved.\n3. 1 Oriein of Swarnim Sewa ConcePt\nBecause of the initiatives of the Central Govt. for easier air transportation lrom\nsmaller cities to the metropolitan cities under Regional connectivity Schemes (RCS), a\ndrastic increase of passenger's footfall at airports has been noticed.

Intensive soft skill training will enable our swarnim Sewa staff in\npersuading such passengers to cooperate during PESC and will also help in reduction\nof complaints as most of the complaints are associated with the security check point.\nour Swarnim sewa staff should have a deep knowledge of the procedures, should have\na smiling face and should be adequately trained to use requesting language instead of\ncommanding / authoritative words. After security check, a soft word of thanks and\nappreciation of the passenger's cooperation should be inciuded in the habit of our\nSwarnim sewa screeners.

This application will enable Passengers with\nspecial need to contact Swarnim Sewa team of Departing / Arriving Airport in\nadvance. It wilt also be useful in getting feedback on Swarnim Sewa and thus, will\nalso help in continuous improvement.\n5.6 Publishing information related to security procedures on the\nCISF website\nAs we see in the cases of most of the developed countries, the information related to\nsecurity procedure / travel guidelines are published on the website of Airport\nSecurity Agency which is not implemented in our case. Most of the travellers still do\nnot know about the BCAS and they still think that CISF is the only law making and\nlaw enforcement agency at Airports. In order to know about the security procedures,\nCASOs of different airports receive letters / e-mails from passengers containing such\nqueries.

  "27": "7. Ouestions related to Swarnim Sewa\nThis section of the document tries to answer some of the common questions which\nmay arise in respect of working of Swarnim Sewa concept. Although, it has been tried\nto cover a1l the aspects of Swarnim Sewa in previous sections, many such questions\nare discussed as below:-\n7. 1 Does Swarnim Sewa impact our core duty?\nSwarnim Sewa does not impact our core duty adversely because:-\nNo rules / procedures are overlooked\nSwarnim Sewa team personnel strictly follow all the mandated rules and procedures\n- not only of CISF but also of Airlines, Airport Operators etc. hence, security is never\ncompromised at any point. This is ensured by regular brieling and supervision of\nSwarnim Sewa team through multiple channels.\nThorough screening\nOn the contrary, PESC of certain category of passengers is very sensitive (for\nexample, passenger with prosthetic limb), and Swarnim Sewa team is proved to be\nof immense help as the passenger extends full support. When the passenger is\nfacilitated from the Ramp/ Departure gate, the passenger feels privileged and\ncomfortable after receiving unexpected help from CISF, therefore, he does not\nhesitate in extending his support in co-operating during security procedures while\nearlier, it was a very challenging task for the screener. This has raised the\nconhdence among our screeners.\nIncreased Profiling\nIn order to identify one needy passenger, Swarnim Sewa team keenly observes and\nprofiles around each and every passengers. This is a hidden advantage of this\ninitiative as 2-3 trained personnel are engaged in round the clock passenger\nprofiling at different areas of the terminai, thus, mitigating the threats from\ncriminals who disguise as oId aged or disabled persons to smuggle prohibited items\nor to hide their identity. If such elements are accompanied throughout by CISF\npersonnel, there are good chances that they get revealed due to nervousness.\nTherefore, considering all the above points, Swarnim Sewa, in lact compliments and\n23",
  "28": "augments the aviation security set up which is a positive impact on our core duty.\n7.2 Should it not be the duty of airlines to give Swarnim Sewa?\nAirlines are private entities and are driven by commercial motive. As such, they lack\nboth, the motivation and the resources, to commence and operate purely welfare\noriented initiative like this.\nMoreover, there are many restrictions on the Airlines staff as far as their access in the\nterminal is considered. For example, they have to enter/exit compulsorily through the\ndedicated staff gate and can't use the departure gates meant for passengers. This\nitself defeats the whole purpose. Further, continuous presence of a private airlines\nmember in SHA is not advisable from security point of view.\nTherefore, though Airlines contribure their bit to ensure a smooth and hassle-free air\ntravel experience for passengers, completely transferring this job to them is neither\nplausible nor practical.\n7.3 Does it not impact our manpower crunch?\nThis topic is already discussed in detail at point no. 5 and the answer is 'No'.\nThe strength derived from Swarnim Sewa team may be compensated from the\nmanpower deployd at- Help desk, office runners, coy writers, CHM, drivers, Shape-II,\nIII personnel, personnel who are temporarily not able to perform hard duties like-\npregnant ladies, lactating mothers, personnel having knee / backbone / shoulder /\njoint pain, personnel having age more than 55 etc. Therefore, the Swarnim Sewa does\nnot impact our manpower crunch.\n7.4 Vlhat are the target passengers of Swarnim Sewa?\nSwarnim Sewa is a noble initiative aimed at extending a helping hand to needy\npassengers at lhe Airporl.\nA dedicated team comprising of 2-3 personnel, depending upon the passenger 1oad,\nincessantly proliles passengers to look out for those in need. Generally, old-aged\npersons, pregnant women, women travelling with infants, differently abled persons\nand first time fliers comprise of the target group.\nOnce identified, such passengers are approached and assistance is provided at each\nstage till they board the flight.",
  "29": "7.5 What type of assistance is provided?\n. Web check-in\n. Generation of Boarding Pass\n. Wheelchair, if required\n. Check-in at Airline counter\n. Help in security procedures at SHA.\n. Guiding towards the designated Boarding Gate.\n. Booking taxi/cab for arrival passengers.\n7.6 What are the advantages of Swarnim Sewa?\nThe team is comprised of highly motivated and willing personnel who have in-depth\nknowledge of al1 the Airport procedures. Preference is given to those who can speak\nand understand the local language. They are regularly briefed and supervised by GOs.\nProper documentation is made by maintaining records of the passengers assisted in\neach shift. Feedback from passengers is also obtained and recorded regularly. Many\npassengers and their children express gratitude by writing mails or tweeting about the\ninitiative. A compilation of all such mails and tweets is formed and updated regularly.\nAdvantages:\n. The personnel in Swarnim Sewa team derive a feeling of satisfaction from\nhelping needy people. This helps relieve their stress and keep them motivated.\n. This is an initiative which is proving to be a game changer when it comes to\nuplift the image of the \"Uniformed Forces\" in the eyes of general public. If\nextrapolated at all airports across the country, this will give a huge boost to the\nprestige and goodwill of CISF.\n. Taking a cue from Swarnim Sewa personnel, other ASG personnel deployed lor\nsecurity duties have also inculcated the urge to help passengers and have\nshaped their behavior and body language accordingly. Such an attitude draws a\nvery positive response from the passengers who in turn subject themselves to\nsecurity check with full co-operation and without much reluctance. This is\nevident from drastic reduction in passenger complalnts about security\nprocedure.\n25",

  "31": "S.Conclusion\nwe have deeply analyzed al1 the aspects related to Passengers with special needs and\ntheir journey at airports including security checks which is our direct concern. we\nalso discussed the legal Rights of such persons along with the punishment for\nviolations.It can also be understood that the rights of these persons are commonly\nignored by general masses despite, these person seldom go legally against any\nindividual for any violation of such rights.\nKnowing that PWDsrequire special attention / assistance while travelling through\nairport because of the procedurai difficulties, it becomes the mandate of each and\nevery agency working at airports to make their travel easy.However, the Government\nis responsible to provide facilities for such persons at transportation hubs including\nbus stops, railway stations and airports, it is also the moral responsibility of\nCISF/ASGs as we arefunctioning under the superintendence of the Central\ngovernment. In addition to this, it also becomes our moral responsibility to facilitate\nsuch passengers on humalitarian grounds.\nWhile the matter regarding structural up gradation lies in the domain of Airlines and\nAirport operators, ASG can stil1 make a lot of difference by realigning its mandated\nprocedures through training and innovations in implementation of the rules and\nregulations so as to minimize the factors that can cause confusion and terrible travel\nexperiences for persons with disabilities. It is also felt that the rules and regulations\nare quite comprehensive and a 'smart implementation' of the regulation is the need of\nthe hour.\nSwarnim Sewa 1itera11y means \"Golden Service\". It is without any doubt a se1fless,\nvolunteer and humane face of the CISF. It is a practical approach which will provide\nupper hand to CISF while dealing with PRMs as it will strengthen the airport security\nby inviting extended cooperation from the PRMs during security check. This can be\nachieved through regular training of the staff, periodic review of the procedures and\nconstant upgradation by adoption of better practices and discarding the outdated/\nintrusive ones. It will also help in minimizing the suffering of other needy passengers\nat airport who are not PRM but are in need of assistance due to other reasons.\n21",
