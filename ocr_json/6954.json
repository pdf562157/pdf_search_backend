DESCRIPTION\n\n\u201cThis will give the guidelines of the buddy system, which is wtlized while dealing\nwith various situations- be it patrolling, hostile threat, operations ete .\n\n\u2018The object of buddy system is that when one person is on duty or advancing, then\nthe other person can observe/keep vigil and cover him.\n\nHence, it is imperative that there should be proper understanding amongst them-\nstrong points, weaknesses and understanding of each others personal traits\n\n2, PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVE\n\nIt covers the following:\n\nThe buddy system of working.\nThe contact jawan and his responsi\n\u2018* The cover jawan and his responsibilities\n\u00abChanging roles\n\n3. THE \u201cCOMBAT-L\u201d IN BUDDY SYSTEM\n\nThis system is based on teamwork and states that all jawans should work in pairs\nwhile dealing with insurgents. The jawan who questions and handles the insurgent is called the\ncontact jawan and the other jawan who provides him armed cover is called the cover jawan.\n\u2018They form a buddy pair. The position in which a buddy pair stands is called the COMBAT-L-\nposition. The covering jawan is on the either flank of the contacting jawan. They form a contact\ncover buddy pair against the insurgents. This position helps prevent cross firing hazards between\nthe buddies and allows better observation and control over the insurgents. The COMBAT-L is\nillustrated as:\n\nCOVER SUBJECT CONTACT\n4, ROLE OF A CONTACTING JAWAN\n\nThe contact jawan is the primary jawan and conducts all business with the\nsuspect. He:\n* Conducts the entire questioning process.\n\u00a9 Searches the suspect for weapons and searches the vehicle, luggage ete,\nif required\nIssues all directions to violators.\nControls the suspect if required.\nHelps complete the detaining process if any evidence is recovered\nduring search.\nGenerally handle all communications.\n\u00a9 fhe is carrying search, he may not be armed.\n",
  "13": "<5, ROLE OF A COVERING JAWAN\n\n\u201cThe cover jawan\u2019s primary function is to protect the contacting jawan and him.\n\u2018The use of a covering jawan generally discourages the subject from attacking,\nWith a covering jawan, the suspect is also less likely to attempt escape. The cover\njawan:\n\n\u00abFocuses his full attention on covering the suspect by @ position of advantage\nand control\n\n* Observes whether the suspect is trying to hide or conceals weapons and watns\nthe contacting jawan.\n\n\u00abProvides immediate help to the contact jawan if the subject attempts to attacks\nthem.\nMonitors surrounding area for other hostile activities/threats.\nIs suitably armed.\n\n6, CHANGING ROLES\n\nIf the jawans do not know how to work together as a team, the cover jawan may\ncontribute to the contact jawan\u2019s problems. Changing roles is necessary in order\nto insure better control and handling o the suspect of insurgent. Out of the buddy\npair, who will do what, will depend on:\n\nSize and physical ability of the suspect.\n\n* Language of the suspect.\n\n* Personal Knowledge about the subject\n\n# Skills allowing better control of the suspect.\n\nFor better understanding, the buddies should be trained together and\noperate, They should also have a good understanding of each other i.e strong\npoints, weakness, likings/dislikings and other personal traits.\n\n8. CONCLUSION\n\nRemember that the buddy system is a basic concept, which if followed, will\nincrease a jawan\u2019s effectiveness in patrolling, naka duty and morcha duty.\n\nseeeennnee\n",

It is imperative to mention\nhere that supervisory/Coy Commander must have knowledge about the\ncapability, efficiency and behaviour of the concerned duty personnel and\nimportance of each and every duty post. Accordingly, the deployment should\nbe vetted before making the duty deployment chart. It further reflects lack of\ninteraction of the Coy Commander and Company GOs with the rank and file,\n\nLack of knowledge of the BCAS circulars on the part of duty personnel\n\nThis type of attitude as displayed by the ASI/Exe sends a negative signal to the\npublic about our professionalism and sincerity towards our work, which is not\nacceptable. We must strive hard to negate this impression.\n\n(iv) Need to give on job training or briefing regarding required rules and\n\nregulations issued by BCAS as well as by this HQ and also about soft skills.\n\n",

The CISF person got severely injured in his shoulder and\nback and had to be admitted in the ICU of the nearest hospital. The unfortunate incident\nreflects lack of security coverage in the CISF unit, leaving the scope for a person, with\n\n|_ Malicious intent, to gain access into the unit line.\n\n03.

Even if\ncigarettes are detected, the possibility of presence of means to light them should be\nkept in mind.\n\nii, Screeners should profile passengers when they approach for frisking. If the pockets\nare found bulging, the passengers should be asked to empty them before being\nfrisked. If the contents of their pockets suggest that they are smokers (presence of\ncigarette packs etc), pat down search, specially the pocket regions, should be\ndone. Their hand baggage should also be physically checked, if it is necessitated\n\nil, The possibility of some passengers trying to carry such items surreptitiously by\nhiding them in their socks, behind the belt buckle or inside the laptops, should be\nkept in mind.\n\n4, All DISG/AP should also ensure that the above mentioned directions are complied\nwith in totality by the CASOs under their jurisdiction.\nEncl: As above.\n\nPigs\n(Rajiva Ranjan Sahay)\nIG/Airport Sector\n\n\u00ae\n",

In the existing practice for installation of watch towers, on every 01 km, it\nis not feasible to keep watch on the entire perimeter area especially in view of the\nfact that there is no working gadgetry to monitor the perimeter.\n\n02. At many places, the boundaries are zigzag in nature and the sight between\ntwo watch towers is lost. Further, it is not possible to have eye contact between\nthe sentries deployed at all the watch towers. The Perimeter Intrusion Detection\nSystem is also not in place at any of the ASG. As such, there is absence of any\nCCTV coverage of the perimeter area. In order to cover this aspect, APS had\nalready taken up the matter with BCAS for revising the existing norms and\nreducing the distance up to 300 mtrs for a clear cut line of sight between 02\nwatch towers and effective perimeter area security.

This is highly objectionable even\nthough, photography is allowed in the terminal building. The photography by the\npassenger in the SHA area also speaks about inattentiveness of duty personnel\nand relaxed observation by the other CISF personnel.\n\n03.

In another airport, local\npolice personnel were allowed, without having valid permission, to enter into the\nterminal building, by a Gazetted Officer of the ASG. Further, at another airport\ncertain followers were frequently allowed to enter into the terminal building without\nhaving valid documents/permission.\n\n3. It should be the endeavor of CASOs/Gazetted Officers of the ASGs to\nstrengthen the security apparatus in strict adherence to the rules and guidelines\nrather than misusing the security procedures. However, the above aberrations\nclearly show non compliance of existing guidelines/ instructions. It is also\nindicative of distraction of CASOs/Gazetted officer from their core functions.

In first case, one married\nSub-Officer, deployed in QRT, had unauthorizedly entered into the ladies hostel\nand went to the.room of an unmarried female member of the Force at odd hours\nof night. When both of them were inside the room, the other female members\nreported the matter to the senior officer, who in turn, caught them inside the room.\nThe Sub-officer was allowed inside the hostel by the female member and during\n@nquiry, they both deposed that they knew each other since long and were\n\u2018friends\u2019.\n\n2. In another case, at one of the ASG, one married Sub-Officer with 02\nchildren, living as family member in the Unit, had developed very close\nrelationship with an unmarried Lady Constable. This was going on for almost last\n06 months and the said Lady Constable started pressurizing the Sub-Officer to\nmarry her. It is obvious that this was seen or known to many unit personnel but\nwas not reported to APS HQ or FHQrs either by the CIW team or Unit\nadministration. The whole issue was allowed to escalate to a stage where both of\nthem decided to marry, wherein the sub-officer planned to divorce his wife while\nthe lady Constable threatened to commit suicide. This is a very serious issue and\nadversely impacts the families of ali concerned.\n\n3. In both the incidents, it has been noticed that relationship developed due to\nclose proximity during working hours especially in the SHA area. The indication of\ngrowing intimacy must have been noticed by other personnel working in the ASGs\nand it is expected that such information should reach the Unit Commander, if not;\nit clearly indicates intelligence failure and poor administrative contro! of the Unit\nCommander. When such information reaches the Sector HQrs at a very belated\nstage and by that time, it is too late to take any preventive action.\n\n4. \u2018Non reporting of above incidents at initial stage, appears that efforts are\nlacking on the part of concerned CASOs and effective action has not been taken\nby the Unit CIW.

Briefing and debriefing is essential. CASO, GOs and SOs should, therefore, have\nproper interaction with the personnel during the course of duty, briefings and\ngames,\n\n4, Amechanism must be created at unit level so that any unusual/abnormal behavior\nobserved is immediately brought to the notice of the Unit Commander without any\ndelay. Personnel affected with different symptoms including, among others, long\nterm insomnia, addiction to aloohol/drugs, depression due \u2014 to\nmarita/domestic/work place related problems, personality disorders, mental as\nwell serious illness and financial crisis form the set of vulnerable persons who are\nmore likely to be disorganized and imbalanced.

Once unusual behavior is noticed, assessed and confirmed, administrative\ndecision needs to be made regarding non-deployment of such personnel for duty\nwith arms/ammunition.

This openness and sincerity on the part of the Unit\nCommander will certainly help in generating confidence between the Unit\nCommander and the personnel.\n\nThe \u2018Drop-box\u2019 mechanism should be introduced at every ASG facilitating the\nForce personnel to freely give their suggestions, inputs, complaints by putting\ntheir letters in a drop-box installed at the unit mess/recreation hall/any other\nconvenient place without the fear of being noticed, should be implemented.

They are not able to understand the factual position of the case. Even,\nthe liaisoning with local administration is also affected adversely due to lack of\nknowledge of local topography, language etc.\n\n3, As such, all DisG under Airport Sector are once again directed to ensure that\nthey should review the deployment of personnel in Crime & Intelligence Wing and\nensure that local CISF personnel are detailed in Crime & Intelligence Wing as In-\ncharge. If not possible then at least a member should be included who knows the\nlocal language, so that the desired purpose may be fulfilled.\n\nSdxx 13.07.2015\n(RR Sahay)\nInspector General/APS\n",
