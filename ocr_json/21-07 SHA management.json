It is\n\u2018our area\u2019 so to say. The ambience of the SHA should accordingly be tidy,\n\norganized, professional and sombre. However, certain irregularities in this\nregard have been reported recently. ASG personnel, particularly those\nperforming screening duties, are often found absent from their duty posts on\none pretext or the other like taking a break for freshening up, lunch, tea\nbreakfast etc without taking into account the flow of passengers at that time.\nThis tendency implies lack of professionalism and is avoidable as it projects an\nadverse image about the Force. It must be realized that security duties at the\nairport have @ passenger-facilitation aspect. Hence, under no circumstances\ncan the passengers be left in the lurch or waiting in queues as our personnel\ntake a break. Similarly, the SHA should be clean and on duty personnel well\nturned out as it reflects on the discipline and morale of the Force.\n\n02. In view of the above, the following instructions are being issued towards\nproper SHA management:\n\n(i) Pre-embarkation security checks/ screening in the SHAs should\ncontinue uninterrupted during operation of flights utilizing all\nresources i.e. manpower and gadgetry.

If operations need to be halted on account of unavoidable\nreasons, like the call of nature of on duty staff or the breakdown of\nany security equipment, a suitable replacement must be arranged by\nthe I/C SHA. Moreover, If any post is unmanned due to such reasons,\nIt will be our responsibility to ensure that the matter is explained to the\npassengers and they are guided accordingly by our staff (/C SHA or\nLoading Pt. officer) to proceed to the appropriate location for pre-\nembarkation security checks.\n\nCont P/2\u2014\n\n",
