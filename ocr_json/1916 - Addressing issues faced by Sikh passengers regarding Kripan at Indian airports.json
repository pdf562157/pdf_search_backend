These passengers\nhave reported that CISF personnel at Indian airports are compelling them to remove even small\n(1-inch or smaller) Kirpans worn as necklaces or souvenirs. Some Sikh passengers have raised\nconcems that this treatment amounts to racial profiling, as passengers of other faiths wearing\nsmall Trishuls or Crosses do not face similar restrictions.
