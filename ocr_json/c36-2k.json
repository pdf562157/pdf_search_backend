  "1": "CIRCULAR 36/2000 \n \nSUB: INSTALLATION OF CLIP \n \n \n \nCases of hoax bomb calls by miscreants are very frequent causing precious loss of \ntime and resulting in interference with civil aviation operations. While call tracing facilities \nhave been provided on the telephones installed at the airports, the same have not been \nprovided on the telephones of airlines at their city offices.  As a result, the miscreants who \ncommunicate such information on these telephones are not traced.  It has, therefore, been \ndecided that in order to trace such hoax telephone calls, all airlines operators will equip their \ntelephones at their city offices / residence of Station Managers with call tracing facility and \ndetails of all such telephones will be communicated to the RDCOS, BCAS to enable them to \nmaintain proper record.  \n \n  \n \n \n (R.K.Singh) \nADDL.COMMISSIONER OF SECURITY (CA) \n \nNO.CAS-7(15)/97-DIV-I \nDated : 16.11.2000"
