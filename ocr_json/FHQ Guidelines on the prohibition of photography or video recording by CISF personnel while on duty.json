This conduct is a clear display of\nnegligence on their part and projects a negative image of CISF in the public\ndomain.\n2. This act of CISF personnel not only jeopardizes security but also\nraises concerns regarding professional competence as a Central Armed\nPolice Force. CISF is deployed at extremely sensitive locations and even a\nminor security breach could attract media attention, leading to negative\npublicity of the organization.\n3. ln view of the above, it is requested that all unit commanders under\nyour administrative control may be directed to sensitize the unit personnel\nto abstain from engaging in such undesirable act. Further, strict action must\nbe taken against the personnel found indulging in such act.\n,*\"\"\",n}n't(\\A)','\nlnspector Gen$l/Tech & Prov."
