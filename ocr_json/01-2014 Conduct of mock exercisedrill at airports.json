Director General/Airport Sector\nCentral Industrial Security Force\n(Ministry of Home Affairs)\n\nCISF HQrs, 13 CGO Complex,\nLodhi Road, New Delhi - 03\n\nNo.0-42015/CISF/APS/OPS/AHE/14/ gr 60 Dated Vy March\u20192014\n\nCircular No.AS_O | /2014\n\nSubject: Conduct of mock exercise/drill at airports\n\nMock exercises/drills are conducted once a week in various scenarios by\nAirport Security Groups (ASGs) all over the country. The methodology of these\npreparatory exercises have been evaluated with a view to realize qualitative\nresults from these exercises/drills. It has been felt that conducting a mock drill\nweekly is not yielding desired results and proving to be mundane and counter-\nproductive. Keeping this in view, it has been decided that one.mock exercise/drill\ncovering one eventuality/scenario should be conducted in all seriousness not\n\nmore than once in a calendar month.\n\nZF It is desired that all exercises conducted at a particular airport should be\nwell planned, scripted and done in a very professional manner. These exercises\nshould be observed critically by the senior most officer of the unit. Similarly, the\nZonal DisG should oversee at least one such exercise during their visits/inspections\nof ASGs. ADG/Airport Sector would oversee at least one exercise/drill each at\n\nASGs Delhi and Mumbai in a calendar year during his visit/inspection.\n\n3. A proper feedback on lessons learnt and lacunae observed should be\ncarefully noted and analyzed to remove the deficiencies, if any, so that\n\nsubsequent exercises can be conducted with utmost efficacy.\n",
  "2": "4 The mock exercise/drill so conducted may have involvement of various\nagencies viz. Airlines operator, Airport Operator, Local Police. pax etc. working at\nairports. These arrangements will give a feeling of real time eventuality and help\nus in finding out latent gray areas or weaknesses in our operational preparedness.\nAirports situated near NSG Hubs should also seek the assistance of NSG for\n\nguidance/assistance in conducting such mock drills.\n\nBe Besides, services of GOs/SOs who have attended workshop at NISA\nHyderabad (copy enclosed) on 18.02.2014 and 19.02.2014 should also be utilized\n\nto conduct mock drills/exercises.\n\n6. Since not more than one exercise has to be conducted every month, ten\nexercises may be conducted on following scenarios in 10 months and in remaining\ntwo months, other exercise on other scenarios/eventuality based on local\n\ncondition/topography may be conducted.\n\ni) Attack at Airport on facilities & Airport users (T/B)\nii) Armed attacked within Airport boundaries\n\nArmed attacked on Aircraft\n\niv) Armed attacked from external points near the Airport premises\nv) Unlawful seizure of vital installations\n\nvi) Sabotage of Vital installations\n\nvii) Hostage taking at the Airport,\n\nviii) Use of Aircraft for criminal purposes\n\nix) Fidayeen type terrorist attack at Airport & its Vicinity &\n\nx) Bomb threats.\n",

IN CK CT WN\nAMS{QRT: RPORT! :\n\nAirport security is a highly sensitive and delicate assignment, which\nconstantly requires a very high level of alertness, intelligence and prompt\nreaction on the part of security personnel. A smallest indiscretion or\nimp\u00e9ifection may lead to serious consequences like hijacking etc. |! has\nbeen to the dismay of security agencies proved, time and again, that even\nthe best laid security plans/systems have gfay areas or weaknesses.\nThese are either Inherent or develop over\u2019 the course of time due to\ncomplacency in the men.or some new modus operandi, not catered for in\nthe security plan, adopted by an- intruder or.technical deficiency in the\n\nmachine., Such, chinks in the security, cover may bagnnee by terrorists\nleading to disastrous consequences. |\n\n2 To take care of such contifigencies, provision f\u00b0 \u201cick Ree ction\nTeams of vaned strength, depending upon the threat perceptions c. the\nairport, has been kept These teams, fully armed with appror iate\nweapons, are supposed to be on duty round jhe clock ready to react ina\ncontingency which is beyond the control of normal security, deployment.\n\n3.\" But it has been observed that th\u00e9se QRTS have neither been formed\nby adequately trained personne! nor frequently operationally tested to\nassess their reaction in terms of time and effectiveness. They mainly lack\nin the following areas ;- \u2018i\n\n4) Training in weapon handling, firing and tacics.\n\u2018b): Physical fitness.\n\nc) Motivator\nd) Mock exercises,\n\n",
  "8": "4. _-A-very high level of skills and expertise in weapon handling tactics,\n\nrs\u00bb, aviation security and firing is an inescapable requirement for the QRT\npersonnel at all times. It would therefore be nec\u00e9Ssary to chalk out ~ very\nstrict and wellsplanned \u2018training regime for the personnel to ensure th. . they\nstay trained, physically \u2018ff and highly motivated. \u2018They'Should have at least\n\u2018one period of physical training and two of weapon handling and tactics per\nday. This time can be compensated by excusing them from normal\nregimental activities like PT, Parade, Fatigue etc. They should also be\nmade to fire from the weapons, they carry, at least once in two months.\nEach time they must fire 100 rounds.\n\n5. FORMING OF QRTs :.\n\nNeed les$'to say the QRTs are to be formed by the men who are\nadequately trained. Over 350 CISF personnel mostly from airparts have\nsivady been put through QRT courses run by the NSG in last six months,\niu this strength there are about 8 officers and 40 sub-officers. This\nStrength should be. utilized to form the QRTs. , In case of deficiency, the\ntrained officers\u2019 and. sub-officers should be made to. train the required\nfumber of personel at the zonal/unit level and deficiencies made good.\n\nIt\u2019 addition the \u2018personnel who have done CommandoNWeapon and\nTactics \u201cor similar courses with CISF or any other organisation may also\u2019be\nconsider\u00e9d for deploying in GRTs, if otherwise found suitable.\n\n6. Avery high level of alertness, skill and knowledge is required on the\nPart of personnel forming QRTs as even a small flaw can render the whole\nOperation ineffective. It Is, therefore, necessary to very frequently \u2018check\nthe strength, effectiveness and response time of the QRTs. One way of\ndoing this effectively Is to put the QRTs through Simulated Exercises.\n\n\" a) To test the knowledge bf men oni various procedures.\n\nn) To test \u2018the speed and appropriateness of the responsu to a\ncontingency. os\n\n\u00a2) To develop ability amongst the men to assess a situation and\nresponse to it appropriately and effectively.\n\n4) To sharpen already acquired skills and knowledge on security\nprocedures, systems & tactics,\n",
