This order was issued for better security of \nterminal building.  On implementing the order, it was found that there were long queues \noutside the terminal building creating difficulty both for the passengers and visitors.  \nAdequate facility was also not available for providing shelter to the queued up people \noutside the terminal building.  CISF looking after security of 27 airports, other airlines \nand also AAI have expressed their difficulty in implementing this order.  Taking into \nconsideration the difficulty faced by both passengers and visitors it has been decided to \nwithdraw this order with immediate effect. \n \n \nHowever the security personnel on reasonable suspicion may detain persons for \nfrisking and checking at the entrance itself. \n \n \n (R.K.
