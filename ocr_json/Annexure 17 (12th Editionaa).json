The provisions of the Standards and Recommended Practices in this document are to be applied by \nContracting States. \n \n \nNotification of differences. The attention of Contracting States is drawn to the obligation imposed by Article 38 of the \nConvention, by which Contracting States are required to notify the Organization of any differences between their national \nregulations and practices and the International Standards contained in this Annex and any amendments thereto. Contracting \nStates are invited to keep the Organization currently informed of any differences which may subsequently occur, or of the \nwithdrawal of any difference previously notified. A specific request for notification of differences will be sent to Contracting \nStates immediately after the adoption of each amendment to this Annex. \n \n \nContracting States are also invited to extend such notification to any differences from the Recommended Practices \ncontained in this Annex, and any amendment thereto, when the notification of such differences is important for the safety of \nair navigation. \n \n \nAttention of States is also drawn to the provisions of Annex 15 related to the publication of differences between their \nnational regulations and practices and the related ICAO Standards and Recommended Practices through the Aeronautical \nInformation Service, in addition to the obligation of States under Article 38 of the Convention. \n \n \nPromulgation of information. Information relating to the establishment and withdrawal of and changes to facilities, services \nand procedures affecting aircraft operations provided according to the Standards and Recommended Practices specified in this \nAnnex should be notified and take effect in accordance with Annex 15. \n \n \nUse of the text of the Annex in national regulations. The Council, on 13 April 1948, adopted a resolution inviting the \nattention of Contracting States to the desirability of using in their own national regulations, as far as practicable, the precise \nlanguage of those ICAO Standards that are of a regulatory character and also of indicating departures from the Standards, \nincluding any additional national regulations that were important for the safety or regularity of air navigation.

In the latter case, the pilot shall continue to use the specified \ncode unless otherwise advised by ATC. However, a pilot may select Mode A Code 7700 whenever there is a specific reason to \nbelieve that this would be the best course of action. \n \n. . . . . . \n \n1.6    UNLAWFUL INTERFERENCE WITH AIRCRAFT IN FLIGHT \n \n \n1.6.1    If there is unlawful interference with an aircraft in flight, the pilot-in-command shall attempt to set the transponder \nto Mode A Code 7500 in order to indicate the situation. If circumstances so warrant, Code 7700 should be used instead. \n \n \n1.6.2    If a pilot has selected Mode A Code 7500 and has been requested to confirm this code by ATC (in accordance with \n1.1.5), the pilot shall, according to circumstances, either confirm this or not reply at all. \n \n \nNote.\u2014 If the pilot does not reply, ATC will take this as confirmation that the use of Code 7500 is not an inadvertent false \ncode selection. \n \n \n \n \n\u2014 END \u2014",
