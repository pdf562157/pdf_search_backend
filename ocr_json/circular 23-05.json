  "2": "RESTRICTED \n \n2 \n2. \nGENERAL PRINCIPLES OF SCREENING : \n \n2.1 \n The basic rule is that all passengers and all their carry-on baggage must \nundergo screening before being allowed access to an aircraft, sterile area or security \nrestricted area.  This procedure must be applied to all international and domestic \noperations. Similar screening requirements should be applied to all other persons, \nincluding flight and cabin crew, requiring access to security restricted areas containing \nscreened passengers or access to aircraft. \n \n2.2 \n Screening of passengers and cabin baggage may be carried out by the use of \nmetal detectors, X-ray equipment or other explosive detection devices, by manual \nsearch or by a combination of equipment and manual search.  In the interests of \nfacilitation and to reduce the number of passengers subjected to manual search, \nexperience has shown that screening equipment should be used as a matter of course. \nManual search can be effective, provided there is ample time and the procedures are \nconducted by well  trained and skilled personnel.  However, X-ray equipment and other \nexplosive detection equipment will always be required to search items which cannot be \nadequately cleared by a manual search. \n \n2.3 \nTechnical equipment  i.e. X-ray BIS, DFMDs, HHMDs, Explosive trace detector \netc. must be checked by CTP/OTP and be fully operational before commencing of duty \nin a shift faulty equipment should not be used. \n \n2.4 \n Technical equipment used for the screening of persons and baggage has \nlimitations. Walk-through metal detectors and hand-held metal detectors, for example, \ncannot detect non-metallic weapons and explosives and even conventional X-ray \nequipment has difficulty in imaging or defining explosive material effectively. To \ncompensate for such limitations or to introduce a random element into the selection \nprocess, an additional manual hand search of passengers and cabin baggage is \nrequired after being screened by technical means. \n \n \n2.5 \n  Selection of cabin baggage for hand search by X-ray operator should always be \nmade using the principle of reasoned selection and in a consistent manner throughout \nthe period cabin baggage is being processed. Reasoned selection means that the \nselection is based on the X-ray image, concentrating the effort on those bags most likely \nto conceal a prohibited item.  Random selection should be used for hand searching one \nout of every five persons and always in conjunction with those passengers who alarm \nthe technical equipment being used for screening. \n \n2.6 \n  It is imperative that the screening of persons and cabin baggage not cease \nwhen a single weapon or device is detected since multiple weapons, devices or \nprohibited item can present on a person or in  cabin baggage. \n \n2.7 \n   Persons who cannot be cleared by the normal screening process should be \nreferred for manual hand-search.  Any person who cannot be satisfactorily cleared by \nthe total screening process inclusive of manual hand-search be denied boarding.",
  "3": "RESTRICTED \n \n3 \n2.8 \n  Privacy should be assured when manual hand-search of the person is to be \ncarried out.  If special rooms are not available, portable screens may be used for this \npurpose.  In all cases the manual hand-search of the person should normally be done \nby an individual of the same sex and preferably in the presence of a third party. \n \n2.9 \n Individuals must not be permitted to retain any hand-carried items in their \npossession during the screening of their person, and they should be required to divest \nthemselves of all extraneous metal, for example, sets of keys, cigarette lighters or \nmobile/cellular phones, prior to being processed. \n \n2.10  In the interest of effective security and passenger facilitation, a manual search of \nthe person or baggage should be conducted in accordance with the following basic \nguidelines: \n \n(i) \nConsent should first be gained from the person being searched. \n(ii) \nThe searcher should be tactful, courteous and use caution. \n(iii) \nIt is important to adopt a systematic approach so that no part of the body, \nitems of clothing or areas of the bag are overlooked. \n(iv) \nAny items being carried should be searched and preferably passed through \nX-ray or other explosive detection equipment. \n(v) \nBaggage must be matched with the correct person/owner and positioned on \nthe search table so the owner can open the bag, but not interfere with the \nconduct of the search. \n(vi) \nItems found in baggage which could conceal a prohibited article should be \nopened or subjected to screening by X-ray or other explosive detection \nequipment. To increase the detection of prohibited articles such items should \nbe X-rayed alone without extraneous clutter. \n(vii) \nBaggage must not be returned to the person until the person has also been \nhand searched. \n(viii) \nOn completion of the search it is important to thank the person for \ncooperating. \n \n3.     SUPERVISOR AND HIS RESPONSIBILITIES \n \n3.1 \nThere must always be a trained supervisory officer present when passenger \nscreening is taking place. \n3.2 \nBefore leaving the screening area, the supervisor must appoint another security \nofficer to act as supervisor during their absence. \n3.3 \nScreening shall not commence without there being sufficient trained staff present \nto operate required number of check-points. \n3.4 \nThe Supervisor shall ensure that officers are assigned to tasks required for \nscreening operation. \n3.5 \nThe Supervisor is responsible for ensuring the covert alarm systems in use are \nregularly tested and are in working order. \n3.6 \nThe Supervisor is responsible for ensuring that all operational equipment remains \nin working order. \n3.7 \nThe supervisor shall ensure that officers carry out their assigned tasks in an \nefficient and effective manner. All policies, procedures and standards must be \ncomplied with.",

The \nSupervisor shall remain responsible until all action is complete or the incident is \nhanded over to another person in authority. \n3.9 \nThe Supervisor shall deal with any dispute arising during screening procedures in \naccordance with prescribed norms. In doing so, the Supervisor shall be aware of \nthe need for public relations but shall not permit security or safety to be \ncompromised. \n3.10 The Supervisor shall ensure that all records and other documentation are \ncorrectly completed at the conclusion of screening. \n3.11 The Supervisor will constantly assess the need for operation of additional \ncheckpoints and make arrangements to anticipate the need. Long queues of pax \nshall be avoided as these are risky from security point of view. \n3.12 Outside normal screening hours, the Supervisor may, at his/ her discretion, \nreduce the staff at the screening point to a minimum. \n \n4. SCREENING AND CLEARANCE OF PERSONS  \n \n4.1 \nThere are many places on the body that can be used to conceal items and which \nare difficult to search. Likewise items can be concealed in many items of clothing such \nas jacket linings, padding of shoulders, hats, ceremonial/religious head-dresses, ties, \npockets, collars, lapels, waistbands, belts, tops of shoes and boots, platform heels/soles \nof shoes and boots. Items can also be hidden in everyday articles carried by the person \nbeing searched (e.g. newspapers, books). \n \n4.2 \n Screening of male persons should normally be carried out in the open (i.e. not in \ncubicles). However, screeners should not expose to public view classified or private \ndocuments nor should they draw attention to currency or valuables in the possession of \na person being searched. \n \n4.3 \n Screening of female passenger by HHMD or by hand shall be done by making  \nuse of portable screens so that privacy is assured. \n \n4.4.  Physical search  of persons should be carried out in private i.e. in special rooms \nor behind portable screens, when it is necessary to search in sufficient depth to \nestablish whether a passenger is carrying a prohibited article. When searches are \nundertaken in private, two searchers of the same sex as the person being searched are \nto be present. \n \n4.5 \nMethod \n \n4.5.1 At all times when screening is taking place, one frisking officer (trained and \ncertified screener) will be detailed for each magnetometer (DFMD/AMD) at all \noperational security check points. All such officers will be equipped with Hand Held \nMetal Detector (HHMD) before commencing duty. They will check all equipment to \nensure that these are in working order. The frisking officer will stand on the sterile side \nof the DFMD/AMD in such a way as to be able to be observe persons approaching the \nscreening point and  to be able to be monitor DFMD. No person shall proceed  past the \nscreening point without first being cleared by the frisking officer. The officer will also",

Frisking officer shall not leave their duties until relieved are until screening \npoint is closed. \n \n4.5.2 All persons shall be screened by means of magnetometer  (DFMD/AMD).  Before \npassing through the DFMD the passenger shall be requested by the Load officer to \nremove all metal objects, that can be removed from his/her body, including cell phone \ncigarette packets, etc.; and keep these in a plastic  tray which will be placed at  the input \nend of the X-ray machine. Similarly the persons will also be required to remove their \nouter coats and jackets including suit and sport coats, athletic warm-up jackets and \nblazers. However sport coat and blazer if being worn as outermost garment \u2013 not being \nworn over a blouse or  sweater for example, does not have to be removed, sweaters \nmay remain on unless they contain significant amount of metal or their size and bulk \nhas potential to be used to conceal dangerous articles. All such items will be placed on \nthe plastic tray and screened through X-ray.    \n \n4.5.3 In case the DFMD/AMD alarm is activated, or whenever the screener deems it \nnecessary, the relevant person will be subjected to additional screening. \n4.5.4 If the alarm in DFMD/AMD indicates presence of metal in the shoes, then the \nperson will be required to remove his shoes and thereafter again screened through \nDFMD. The shoes will be screened through X-ray. \n \n4.5.5 Additional screening will be done by means of :\u2013 \n \n(a) \nhandheld metal detector , or \n(b) \nPat down search, or \n(c) \nBy combination of both the above means. \n \n4.5.6 Pat down search of a person will be carried out whenever the screener deems it \nnecessary. However, at least one out of every five persons will be subjected to pat \ndown search on a continuous random basis. \n \n4.5.7 If sealed or otherwise un-identifiable packages are found on any person or \nconveyance being screened, these shall be passed for X-examination. \n \n4.5.8 If after subjecting a person to additional screening the screener is still not \nsatisfied, then the person shall be held at the   screening point and the supervisor \ninformed of it . The supervisor will direct what further action will be taken. \n \n4.6 \nPat-Down Search :  \n \n4.6.1 There are two types of pat-down search, a WHOLE BODY PAT-DOWN SEARCH  \nand a PAT-DOWN SEARCH LIMITED TO THE AREA OF AN ALARM. In both \nsituations, wherever possible the screener should use the back of his/her hands to \nconduct the search.

This course of action should not be taken \nwith a suspect explosive device since it will severely hind the work of explosive \nexperts who will have to deal with the device and even add to the shrapnel effect \nof the device should it explode. \n9.6 \nIf the item is confirmed as a suspect explosive device DO NOT TOUCH IT but \ncarry out standard suspect explosive device procedures. \n9.7 \nIn the case of a weapon or explosive device being detected during the screening \nprocess, the relevant person shall be detained by the screening officer and \nhanded over to local police for further action.  As regards detection of only \nammunition (bullets), detailed instructions issued vide \nCircular No. CAS-3(37)/2002.Div.IIIA dated 28.4.2003 will be followed. \n \n10. SCREENING AND HAND SEARCH ENVIRONMENTS \n \nScreening and hand search environments should conform to the following criteria: \n \n10.1 Passenger and cabin baggage screening should always be carried out \nimmediately adjacent to each other to prevent the transfer of prohibited items \nfrom the person to the baggage and vice versa. \n10.2 They should be designed to facilitate the control of passengers and eliminate the \nrisk of a passenger by-passing the screening procedures. \n10.3 They should be designed to facilitate the different passenger volumes resulting \nfrom the varying number of flights being processed at any one time, with the \nminimum of disruption to operations. \n10.4 They should be equipped with booths or screened areas in which manual \nsearches can be conducted in privacy. \n10.5 They should be equipped with suitable horizontal surface on which cabin \nbaggage may be searched by hand. Such surfaces should be high enough to \npermit inspection without requiring the examiner to bend and sufficiently wide to \nprovide some measure of separation of the baggage from the passenger.
