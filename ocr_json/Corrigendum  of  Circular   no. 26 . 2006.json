A similar search will \nbe required when an aircraft is suspected of being the target of an act of unlawful interference. The difference between \nthe two types is only in the degree and thoroughness of  search undertaken, and these will be dictated by the \ntotal circumstances applicable to each situation. \n \n2. \nThe large number of aircraft in service throughout the world makes it impossible to provide guidance here \nfor recommended aircraft inspection procedures that will be adequate in all cases. Aircraft operators should develop an \naircraft search procedure checklist for each type of aircraft in service and include this checklist as part of the flight crew \nsecurity kit. Use of such a checklist by ground crews will  be  particularly helpful at locations where the only \npersons familiar with the particular type of aircraft or configuration of aircraft are flight deck and cabin crew members. \n \n3. \nThe designated isolated parking position will likely prove to be the best location on the airport at which an \naircraft subjected to a specific threat can be searched, but contingency plans should recognize that it may not always be \npossible to access this position. \n \n4. \nAircraft searches should be carried out in good lighting conditions; this may require the use of  auxiliary \npower units or the attachment of ground power lines to the aircraft.  It will be necessary to impose and maintain control \nof access to the aircraft before starting the search, which should be carried out with the minimum number of persons on \nboard. \n \n5. \nTo avoid duplication of effort, the search of an aircraft should be conducted systematically by staff familiar \nwith the particular aircraft, provided with a checklist and assigned to specific areas of the aircraft. Attention should be \ngiven to those areas to which passengers have had access, such as main  cabins, galley areas and toilets, but \nthe search should also include the flight deck exterior of the aircraft and cargo holds. \n \n6. \nBefore starting the search, strict control of access must be implemented to the aircraft being \nsearched. This is necessary to ensure devices are not introduced into the aircraft once it has been cleared. Control of \naccess must then be maintained until the aircraft doors are closed prior to push back. \n \n7. \nSearchers should be briefed not to touch suspicious objects but to notify the search coordinator, mark the \nlocation with a prominent object (but not touching the device), and withdraw from the immediate area to await further \ninstructions. When a suspect device is discovered, the possibility of secondary devices should not be discounted. \n \n8. \nHand-held communications are useful for coordination of the search and are often the only way of ensuring \nappropriate and speedy lifesaving procedures for search and evacuation. However, once a suspect device has \nbeen located, those using hand-held communications should immediately move away and ensure that they and \nanyone else in the area move outside the cordon as quickly as possible.  Radios should not be used to transmit \nwithin 25 m of a suspect device. \n \n9. \nAll entrance doors, hatches, inlet and exhaust ducts, service and access doors, etc., must be opened to \nallow the necessary access to all areas to be inspected. However, a check must be made to ensure that all doors and \ncovers which were opened for inspection purposes are closed on conclusion of the search. \n \n \nA7-1",
