This document is concerned primarily with those categories of personnel greatest\nsignificance to aviation security activities at airports, namely the staffwho screen passengers and\ncabin baggage and their instructors, managers of security operations, and the auditors who\nmonitor these activities and provide quality control.\nRe-certification shall be conducted by or on behalfofthe appropriate authority and shall include\nelements ofthe initial certification as appropriate.

Technical qualities should be the key elements in the development and use of a\ntest. Two primary technical requirements of tests should be their reliability and their\nvalidity. Reliability can be considered as the consistency ofthe results. For example,\nthe same result is obtained when a particular individual takes the test on two different\noccasions. With respect to validity, the most important type is predictivc virlidity\n\\xhich addresses the test's ability to prcdict pedormance on the job. Without\npredictive validity, a selection test is oflittle use. Tests should show the correlation\nof selection test score to on-the-job perfomance for the tests to be considered\nuseful and cost-effective. Much of the information orl test reliability and validity\nshould be available ftom the testing manual supplied by the test publishers. For a\ncommercially available test, the users of the tests should determine the suitabiliw of\nthe test for a given situation.\n2. Additional relevant qualities include item analysis and fairness. Ihe former should\nd\u20actermine lvhat factors affect error rates, item discrimination, and quality_ The\nlatter should determine if a test has any adverse impact on specific groups such as\nethnic minorities or female test takers, and if so, what strategies should be employed\nto assess bias and minimize the ?rdverse impact ofsuch test items.\nC) Examination\n1. The written/ online examination should focus on the candidate,s knowledge and\nunderstanding of aviation security; international, regional and national\nregulations; and the contents ofnational programmes.\n4.\n2.\n3.\nThe practical examination should evaluate understanding and capability ofcandidates\nto perform their respective AVSEC fuDctions with competency.\nThe certification exams should be conducted under the supervision of, or on behalf\nof, the Appropiiate Authority.
