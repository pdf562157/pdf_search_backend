The weapon is a .32 \ncaliber, double \u2013 barreled firearm about the size and shape of a cell-phone battery pack \n(approximate dimensions: 3 \u201c X 1\u201d X 0.5\u201d or 7.6 cm X 2.5 cm x 1.3 cm).  The weapon lacks \nthe recognizable shape of conventional handguns.  It has a \u201ckey-ring\u201d attachment at one end, \nwhich is used to arm its two firing pins, and two side-mounted firing buttons, which take the \nplace of triggers.  A third side \u2013 mounted button gives access to the firing chambers, which \ncan be loaded with one bullet each.  Forensic examination revealed that, when loaded, the \nweapon is armed by pulling the key-ring attachment and discharged by depressing either of \nthe two firing buttons. The weapon may or may not be carried in a form-fitting leather case. \n \n2. \nTests conducted have determined that a weapon like the one intercepted can be \nwalked through an airport metal detector without activating the alarm, depending on the \nsensitivity of the device.  Additional tests have shown the weapon is detectable by a hand-\nheld wand, within a four-inch proximity, and is clearly revealed by X-ray imagery. While the \nweapon shown up well when X-rayed, it may never the less be difficult to identify because of \nits non-conventional shape, which is not \u201cgun-lime\u201d. \n \n3. \nIn view of the above, I am directed to request that the APS staff may be suitably \nbriefed to be careful while carrying out pre-embarkation security checks. \n \n \n (J.P. VERMA) \nOFFICER ON SPECIAL DUTY (INT) \n \n \n( REF: NO.CAS-6 (3) / 1/ 96-DIV-I \nDated : 16.03.1998",
