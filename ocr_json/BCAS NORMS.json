  "2": "Annexure \u2018A*\n\nInstructions for deployment of ASG Manpower at Airports\n\n.\n\nMinistry of Civil Aviation(MoCA) had constituted a committee jointly vide order\nuv.AV.13024/681/2015-AS dated 27.03.2019 to work out measures for implementing uniform\nand standardized security architecture and evolve a cost optimal and functionally effective\nsecurity arrangement. The committee further constituted a Task Force vide MoCA letter\nNo.AV.13024/68 1/2015-AS Dated 24\" April, 2019 for rationalisation of Deployment of CISF\nmanpower for security at Airports.\n\n2. The report of the Task force was circulated vide BCAS letter no.CAS-3(8)/2012/DIV.1\nNORMS(F-92129) dated 04.07.2019. Based on dratt -A of the Task Force i.e. reduction of\nmanpower by normal rationalisation of deployment norms of Aviation Security Group(ASG)\nat airports, BCAS issued new norms for manpower deployment dated 13.11.2019 incorporating\nthe points of Draft-A of the Task Force Report.\n\n3. Now, for the implementation of the remaining portion of the report of the Task force\n(Draft-B: Rationalisation based on architectural changes & Draft-C: Rationalisation based on\ntechnological up-yradativn), a Study Group under the chairmanship of Sh. Jaidcep Prasad, Jcint\nDG, BCAS, along with members from MoCA, CISF, IB & AAI has been constituted.\n\n4, Accordingly, in consultation with members and after visit of IGI Airport and analysing the\nmanpower for affected duty posts the norms for deployment of ASG manpower at airports issued vide\nBCAS Order dated 13.11.2019 are hereby revised. A chart showing the details of duty posts along with\nmanpower requirement as per new scale is attached herewith.\n\n5. The study group has agreed on the rationalisation of manpower durough architectural changs\ngiven below:\n\ni. Allentry points from cargo complex to airside may be closed and single entry to\nside may be used by creating a suitable modification in perimeter wall for this\npurpose.\nii, Number of vehicle access gate- airside for vehicles or gate with X-BIS/ per gate\nincluding Aviation depot gate / airside may be reduced to the optimum number.\niii, The number of any other gate in perimeter wall if used including hanger gate airsid\u00e9\nmust be minimised.\niv. Number of staff gates to airside should be reduced to minimum and only those gate\nwith X-BIS may be permitted as staff gate.\nv. ATC complex Airside(Unarmed) access control must be closed.\nvi. Lift opening towards airside from non-sterile to sterile area should be closed.\nvii. Approach to BHS control room or conveyor belt area from Terminal Building not\nrequired for category 03 & 04 airports. All such approach points from non-sterile to\nsterile areas should be closed.\nAll entry/exit gate city side-armed support may be reduced to minimum, however,\nQRT may cover this point where CICP has been approved.\n\nHowever, RD, BCAS shall convene a meeting of standing committee for security vetting of design,\nconstruction of new facilities and alteration to existing design and facilities as per BCAS OM dated\n29.01. 2014.The required architectural changes shall be recommended on case to case basis as decided\nby the standing committee. After requisite modifications in the infrastructure, the requisite\nmanpower re-survey shall be done.\n\n",
  "3": "where no power fencing can be installed. Therefore, at Brown field Airports Power fence can be\ninstalled inside the perimeter wall. This will lead to a drastic reduction in manpower deployed at Watch\nTowers. .\n\n7. The committee also agreed that Automatic Tray Retrieval System(ATRS) if installed\nfor two X-BIS will lead to reduction of manpower at PESC points.\n\n8 \u2018The Integrated Command and Control Centre equipped with video analytic software\narmed with face recognition will lead to strengthening of civil aviation security ecosystem of\nthe airports. The prescne4 of physical supervisory officials will be reduced.\n\n9, In addition to the above, the following guidelines as mentioned in O.M, No.CAS-3(8)/2012-\nDiv.(CISF Norms) dated 30.01.2015 and 13/11/2019 were also reiterated:\n\na. The Survey and Re-Survey Committee should take into consideration the time of\noperation, the gates actually operational, the equipment in place, the tsks actually\nperformed and evolving and other security enabling features like intelligent CCTVs,\nPIDs, DIGI Yatra ete. while carrying out survey/re-survey for manpower. The\nmanpower has been prescribed for one shift per terminal. In addition, a round-the-cldck\nNaka at an appropriate location of appropriate strength should be considered, where\npermissible and desirable.\n\nb. Although only male component is indicated for certain duty points of deployment,\nfemale component may be provided as per requirement within overall guidelines.\n\nc. The supervisory pyramid is as per standard norms. However, exact number of ACs and\nofficers of above ranks will depend upon ground realities and norms of MHA and State\nPolice (wherever applicable).\n\nd, Survey/Ke-survey Committee, while doing manpower survey/re-survey, will also take\ninto account the heightened terrorist threats including Naxalites\u2019 threats, and\n\ne. There is scope for outsourcing of tradesmen and drivers. The Survey Committee will\nexaitinte the same on ease to case basis, However, security implications will be kept in\nmind while doing so.\n\nf. Cross-utilisation of executive staff of ASG/CISF may be made for administrative\nand ministerial duties at Airports where passenger traffic is very less.\n\nWherever single agency/regulated agent is assigned the task of screening af cargo, the\nrole of CISF shall be confined to access control and other duties at the airside perimeter\ngates only.\n\n\u00a9\n\nh. Non-scheduled or chartered operators have to make their own arrangements with\ndistrict administration for providing sccurity to their operations.\n\ni. Manpower for help desk (01 ASI per desk) may be provided (but not mandatory)\nterminal-wise during operational hours.\n\nj. Deployment for landside security will be covered under CTCP. \u2018\n\n10. These guidelines cannot be relaxed upwards without the prior specific approval of\n\nMoCA & MHA.\n\n1. The above guidelines are equally applicable to other Private Airport Operators where AAI\ntg mat mananina the atennrtc ond tn the nannernaed Cate Dalina in niece nf CICE wherever\n",
  "4": "12, As mentioned in the previous O.M dated 01/03/2019/2015, the categorization of airports\non the basis of sensitivity viz. (iHypet ~Seusitive and (ii) Sensitive/ Normal airports. Flow of\npassenger traffic and days of operations at the particular airport is retained as under:\n\na) High density \u2014 where average passenger flow is more than 10 lakh per month\n\nb) Medium density ~ where average passenger flow is between I lakh to 10lakh passenger per\nmonth.\n\nc) Low density -where average passenger flow is less than 1 lakh per month\n\n4) The airport having up to 4 flights daily/ 5 days\u2019 operations a week.\n\n13. The guidelines have been given for these four density and are applicable for all terminals\nat hyper-sensitive, sensitive and normal airports. Wherever the guidelines differ for sensitive\n\n/normal, that has been specifically indicated in a separate row against the duty point.\n\n\u00a2\n14. With regard to deployment of security personnel in the rank of ASIs, it is reiterated that\n\ndirectly recruited ASIs (Graduates) are to be posted to ASG/ASPU. In case ASIs are not\ndirectly recruited/available, same number of SI's are to be posted. However, SI's, where\nindicated, cannot be replaced or interchanged with ASI\u2019s.\n\n15. The personnel deployed at the airports shall not be deputed for more than 10 hours (8+2) wherein\ncach shift is considered as 8 hours and if the time of operation exceeds the same by more than 2 hours,\nthen it will be considered as a new shift and the manpower will be budgeted for accordingly.\n\n16. As per MHA OM dated 10/01/2018;all duty posts vacated by the CISF will be manned by\nprivate security agencies.\n\n16, \u2018Transport will be provided to the ASG as per norms prescribed by the MHA/State Police.\n\n17. The Standing Committee for manpower Survey at various airport under RD BCAS will\nimmediately revise the deployment proposal at each airport on the basis of new norms being.\nissued in the present order. Ihe copy of resurvey report will be sent to BLAS Headquarters tor\n\napproval on or before 31/12/2021. The reconciliation of total reduction will be done at BCAS\nHeadquarters.\n\n18. Any new addition/proposal other than the affected duty posts for resurvey will be done\nseparately and approval will be granted through existing procedure.\n\nZEEE RED EOE SHO OOO EEO O REESE EEO G EEE EEE E EDO EDO EEE REESE\n",
