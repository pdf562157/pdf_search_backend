Walk-\nthrough metal detectors and hand-held metal detectors, for example, cannot detect non-\nmetafic weapons and explosives and even conventional X-ray equipment has difficulty in\nimaging or difining exploiive material effectively. To compensate for such limitations and to\nintrJduce a random element into tlte selection process, an additional manual hand search of\npassengers and cabin baggage is required after being screened by technical means'\nv. \n^Sele\"tion of cabin baggage for hand search by X-ray operator should always be made using\nthe principle of reasoned selection and in a consistent manner throughout the period cabin\nbaggage is being processed. Reasoned selection means that the selection is based on the X-ray\nimage, concentiiting the effort on those bags most likely to conceal a prohibited item.\nRandom selection should be used for hand searching one out of every five persons, besides\nwith those passengers who alarm the technical equipment being used for screening'\nvi. It is imperative that the screening of persons and cabin baggage not cease when a single\nweapon or device is detected since multiple weapons, devices or prohibited item can be\npresent on a person or in cabin baggage.\nvii. \nPersons who cannot be cleared by the normal screening process should be referred for manual\nhand-search.

The devices should also be physically checked against any outside interference in the\nmanufacturing.\n5.7. Casts, braces and support appliances will be thoroughly inspected without exposing sensitive\nareas as far as possible. ETD screening will also be used to test for traces ofexplosive materials, where\npossible.\n5. 8. ln case of bandages and/ or dressing, while caution will be observed during pat-down, it needs to\nbe ensured that the covered area is free of threat item. Metal detector, observation and self pat-down\nfollowed by ETD checks may suffice in most cases.\n5.9.
