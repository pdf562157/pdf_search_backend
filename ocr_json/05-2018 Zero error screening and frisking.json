This phenomenon is being witnessed in\nairports after airports. This development raises fundamental questions about our capabllity\nto discharge basic aviation security functions efficiently and competently.\n02. lt is not clear what are the factors behind this. Is it poor training of frisking staff? ls it\ncasualness or lack of focus during frisking? ls it malfunctioning DFMD/HHMDs? ls it poor\nsupervision and incompetence of GOs in monitoring SHA work? Or is it a combination of\nall the above?\n03. Whatever may be the cause, this failure should give us sleepless nights. lt appears\nthat it is not difficull for anyone with sufficient motivation to sneak in a weapon into the\naircraft without being detected. The implication of this should be clear to every senior\nofficer.\n04. ln view of the above, all CASOs are directed to provide onthe-job crash courses to\nall PESC personnel for one week commencing from 26.08.18. Special attention will be\npaid to frisking staff in particular. I again emphasize the need fior 'zero error' during\nscreening and frisking. The responsibility for failure will be fixed on immediate supervisory\nofficers also since they do not seem to be focusing sufficiently on this crucial function.\nA\nllt{ \n,\n(M.A. cana;thriU)'\nADG/Airport Sector\nCopv to\nThe lG (APS-I & ll) -\nAll Zonal DlsG\nTo devote personal attention to PESC work and\nconduct more decoy checks."
