The\nCouncil, on 13 April 1948, adopted a resolution inviting the\nattention of Contracting States to the desirability of using in\ntheir own national regulations, as far as practicable, the precise\nlanguage of those ICAO Standards that are of a regulatory\ncharacter and also of indicating departures from the Standards,\nincluding any additional national regulations that were import-\nant for the safety or regularity of air navigation.

The objective of\naerodrome emergency planning is to minimize the effects of an\nemergency, particularly in respect of saving lives and main-\ntaining aircraft operations. The aerodrome emergency plan\nsets forth the procedures for coordinating the response of\ndifferent aerodrome agencies (or services) and of those\nagencies in the surrounding community that could be of assist-\nance in responding to the emergency. Guidance material to\nassist the appropriate authority in establishing aerodrome\nemergency planning is given in the Airport Services Manual,\nPart 7.\n9.1.1\nAn aerodrome emergency plan shall be established\nat an aerodrome, commensurate with the aircraft operations\nand other activities conducted at the aerodrome.\n9.1.2\nThe aerodrome emergency plan shall provide for the\ncoordination of the actions to be taken in an emergency\noccurring at an aerodrome or in its vicinity.\nNote.\u2014 Examples of emergencies are: aircraft emerg-\nencies, sabotage including bomb threats, unlawfully seized\naircraft, dangerous goods occurrences, building fires and\nnatural disasters.\n9.1.3\nThe plan shall coordinate the response or partici-\npation of all existing agencies which, in the opinion of the\nappropriate authority, could be of assistance in responding to\nan emergency.\nNote.\u2014 Examples of agencies are:\n\u2014 on the aerodrome: air traffic control unit, rescue and fire\nfighting services, aerodrome administration, medical and\nambulance services, aircraft operators, security services,\nand police;\n\u2014 off the aerodrome: fire departments, police, medical and\nambulance services, hospitals, military, and harbour\npatrol or coast guard.\n9.1.4\nRecommendation.\u2014 The plan should provide for\ncooperation and coordination with the rescue coordination\ncentre, as necessary.\n9.1.5\nRecommendation.\u2014 The aerodrome emergency\nplan document should include at least the following:\na) types of emergencies planned for;\nb) agencies involved in the plan;\nc) responsibility and role of each agency, the emergency\noperations centre and the command post, for each type\nof emergency;\nd) information on names and telephone numbers of offices\nor people to be contacted in the case of a particular\nemergency; and\ne) a grid map of the aerodrome and its immediate vicinity.\n. . . . . .\nEmergency operations centre and command post\n9.1.7\nRecommendation.\u2014 A fixed emergency operations\ncentre and a mobile command post should be available for use\nduring an emergency.",
