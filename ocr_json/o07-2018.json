Aviation Security Manual (Doc\n8973) of ICAO also states the requirement of security programme for MRO\n(Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul). A security programme constitutes a\nblueprint for developing a civil aviation security system. It reflects the clearly\ndefined, unambiguous responsibilities assigned to each entities.\n\nDoc 8973 clearly highlights that such facilities should be located at the\nairside and landside boundary of the airport, but staff members should not\nbe allowed to circulate on the aprons used by commercial aircraft. As with\nany other facility with access to the airside, maintenance facilities should\ndevelop their own security programme consistent with the NCASP.\n\nIn addition to the usual threats posed by staff with access to the\nairside, or persons accessing the airside via maintenance facilities, there are\nspecific threats to be considered for maintenance operations, such as\nsabotage of aircraft via maintenance operations, dangerous items placed in\nhidden parts of an aircraft for future use by perpetrators, and deliberate\nactions to create malfunctions of aircraft equipment.\n\n1. Policy\n\n1.1 MRO security programme should be adopted as corporate policy and\nshould describe the objectives with respect to security. It calls for the\nestablishment of a security department and chief security officer whose\nresponsibilities involve achieving the cited objectives. The programme\nshould set out the related responsibilities of employees, and handling\nagents and other contractors. The security measures described should be\nclearly defined and easily understood by those who need to implement\nthem.\n\n1.1.1, MRO security programmes should have a_ security\nclassification in accordance with national guidelines.\n\n1.1.2, In developing MRO security programme, risk should be\nanalysed in depth and the nature and level of threat facing the operator\nshould be assessed. National and airport security requirements,\nprogramme implementation timelines, staffing and financial limitations,\nand enhanced security requirements during times of increased threat,\nshould also be considered. The applicability of the aircraft operator\nsecurity programme should also be appraised, since it may apply only\nto a particular airport or group of airports, a particular service or a\nspecific State.\n\nPage 4 of 18\n",
