There is thus a need to take every reasonable and practicable measure to ensure \nthe protection and safeguarding of passengers, flight crew, ground staff, the general public and civil \naviation facilities against acts of unlawful interference perpetrated on the ground and in flight. These \nmeasures should be customized to counter different levels of threat. \n \n \nThe International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), an agency of the United Nations, seeks to \npromote appropriate levels of aviation security throughout the global community. Through the \nmedium of Annex 17 \"Security\" of the Convention on International Civil Aviation, (the Chicago \nConvention, 1944), ICAO promulgates Standards and Recommended Practices (SARPs) in respect of \ncivil aviation security.  \n \n \nBeing a signatory of the Chicago Convention, India is obliged to implement the Standards and \nRecommended Practices adopted by ICAO. Standard 3.1.1 requires Contracting States \"to establish \nand implement a written national civil aviation security programme\". It requires airport operators: \"to \nestablish and maintain an Airport Security Programme detailing the aviation security measures and \nprocedures which are required to be implemented at the airport and for ensuring their compliance.\" \n \nThis Airport Security Programme has been prepared by the airport operator. The authority for this \nProgramme, however, lies in the National Civil Aviation Security Programme of the India and relevant \nnational legislation. \n \nThe Programme will be subject to amendment from time to time depending on the evolution of the \nthreat and relevant counter measures. Such amendments are to be controlled through the Record of \nAmendments and the List of Effective Pages included in this document. It is the responsibility of each \norganization concerned with civil aviation security to maintain an updated copy of the Programme. \n \nThe Programme has been approved by the DG, BCAS and is reviewed and updated at least once every \ntwelve months. \n \nRelease of information contained in this document in any form to any person, party or organization \nnot properly authorized is prohibited and may result in legal action.",
