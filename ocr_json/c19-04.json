  "10": "Appendix `B\u2019 \n \nSPECIFICATION FOR ON-LINE X-RAY \nBAGGAGE INSPECTION SYSTEM \n \n \n1. \nINTRODUCTION \n \nThe existing X-Ray machines installed at check in area to screen registered \nbaggage are in stand-alone mode and not capable of detecting 100% explosives. \nStand-alone machines occupy space at departure lounges and also cause big queues, \nwhich disrupt passenger flow during peak hours. Keeping in view the security threat, it is \ndesirable that multi level in-line detection system is installed at major airports. The multi \nlevel X-Ray screening system has already been installed at various international \nairports abroad. The online hold baggage handling system (HBS) shall be integrated \nwith airport baggage handling in order to provide complete hold baggage processing \nand screening system. It is recommended that installation of hold baggage screening \nsystem and X-ray BIS conveyer belt may be integrated and the work awarded as turn \nkey project. Depending upon the passengers\u2019 peak hour density the level may be varied \nfrom three to four. Initially on line hold baggage-screening system shall be introduced at \nDelhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata, Ahmedabad, Calicut, Varanasi, Amritsar, Vizag and \nSrinagar airports. All new terminals and airports constructed in future will have only \nHBS. The priority of installation  of HBS shall be decided by AAI in consultation with \nBCAS. \n \n2. \nConceptual System Design \n \nThe system designed for multi level screening process shall have the following \nfeatures: - \n \n2.1 \nLevel 1 \n \nLevel 1 screening is to be undertaken by a high speed multi view / computer sliced X-ray \nmachine with automatic explosives detection facilities. The decision is to be fully automatic and \nthe operator intervention is only required in start-up and shut down procedures. Un-cleared \nbaggage will go to Level 2, and cleared bags will proceed to the baggage make-up area.  \n \n2.2 \nLevel 2 \n \n2.2.1 Level 2 screening is remote workstations(s) whereby operator(s) can analyze the \nimage generated by the Level 1 X-ray machine. The workstation is required to be \nequipped with enhanced imaging / manipulation systems to assist operator to diagnoses \nthe screened image.",
  "11": "2.2.2 Typically 30-40% of all level-1 screened bags would be referred to level 2. \n \n \n2.2.3 Whilst the bag is being referred to level 2, it should be \u2018tracked\u2019 while it travels \nalong the length of the conveyor such that its position and identity is known at all times. \n \n2.2.4 In practice, it is usual to provide a conveying system that allows 15-20 seconds \nto queue and process the level 2 images.  \n \n2.2.5 In case of bigger airports (higher passenger density airport), a workstation 2B \nshall be introduced for longer time analysis. In this instance, there will be enhanced \nimage manipulation capabilities; usually a more senior / experienced operator will view \nthe image.  In addition, the Level 2B screening would not be subject to time constraints \nas for level 2A. The analysis may be carried out between 40 to 120 seconds and 98% \nbags are expected to be cleared. \n \n2.2.6 In systems with multiple level 1 machines, the Matrix type set-up of several level \n1 and level 2 workstations will be linked together, enabling the next un-cleared level 1 \nimage to go to next available level-2 workstation.  The matrix data communication shall \nenable any of the Level 1 X-ray systems to send rejected bag images to any of the \nLevel 2 workstations. The proposed matrix scheme must be flexible enough to \naccommodate future expansion. In all cases, any bag considered suspect by the \noperator are to be flagged and routed automatically to Level 3. \n \n2.2.7 Cleared bags shall proceed to the baggage make-up area. \n \n2.2.8 Any bag not cleared within a pre-determined time by the level 2 operators, are \nconsidered \u2018time-outs\u2019 and automatically forwarded to level 3. In addition any miss-\ntracked bags on the conveying system are defaulted to the level 3 area. \n \n2.3 \nLevel 3 \n \n2.3.1 There are several technologies available for level 3 screening, and the selection \nusually depends upon BCAS regulations and / or budget constraints. These include: \n \n2.3.2 Explosive Trace / Particle detection Check. The un-cleared / suspected bags \nshall be checked with latest explosive trace detectors by using vacuum pump / specially \ndesigned filter papers for checking the presence of explosive substances.  \n \n2.3.3 Explosive Sniffer Dogs.  The dogs being the most reliable explosive detection \nsystem, it is recommended that rejected bag at level 2 be sniffed by Explosive Detection \ndogs. The dogs to be deployed in pair, one for initial sniffing and second for \nconfirmation. The pair of dogs\u2019 to be turned over every one hour. In an 8-hour shift, \nthere should be minimum 4 dogs with handlers.",
  "12": "2.4 \nLevel 4 \n \n2.4.1 All un-cleared / suspected bags at level at level 3 are to be reunited with their \nowners for further inspection and interview. This process is normally manual and should \nbe done in a safe area outside the boundaries of the baggage handling system. \n \n2.4.2 The procedure shall be evolved whereby the passenger and the bag are brought \ntogether.  \n \n2..4.3 Any bag that is still deemed to be suspect after passenger interview, or if the \npassenger cannot be located, are normally handled according to the BCAS instructions \ntill arrival of explosives experts. Bomb detection and disposal squad shall be summoned \nwhere available or the bag shall be shifted to cooling off pit. \n \n3. \nSystem Throughputs \n \n3.1 \nNormally a single on line HBS with Level 1& 2 X-ray machine and tracking would \npractically be able to sustain around 22 bags per minute (1300 bags/hour). This is a \ngood design target. The recommended throughput is 1200-1800 bags per hours. \n \n3.2 \nCTX/EDtS machines with low throughput of 400-500 bags per hour may be \ninstalled as stand alone mode where traffic density is not high subject to availability of \nfund and space  \n \n4. \nApproval by Regulatory agent. \n \n4.1 \nApproval by International/ National regulatory agency: - The X-ray BIS \ndeployed at Level- 1 must be approved by at least three major regulatory agencies of \ncivil aviation `Appropriate Authority\u2019 including the country of product manufacturer such \nas: - \n \na. \nTransport Security Administration (USA), \nb. \nDepartment of Transport (UK), \nc. \nDepartment of BKA,  \nd. \nECAC \u2013 European Union. \ne. \nDepartment of Transport (Australia)  \nf. \nFlughafen Police (Switzerland) and / or, \ng. \nENAC (Italy)  \n \n4.2 \nBesides the product should be approved by the civil aviation    regulatory authority \nof the manufacturing country   \n \n5. \n REQUIREMENTS FOR LEVEL- 1 X-RAY INSPECTION SYSTEM.",

Over-length detection \n30. \n Collector System \u2013 Window Reservation technique \n \n30.1 This feature is applied to those instances where by automatic checks in \nconveyors are provided to deliver bags on to collector conveyors. \n \n30.2 A system known as \u201cWindow Reservation\u201d is used to control the flow of bags. \nEffectively, the belt on the collector conveyor is split up into imaginary zones or \n\u201cwindows\u201d each large enough to accept the bag and these are allocated to check \u2013in \ndesks on a demand basis such that all input have equal opportunity. This reduces \npassenger-waiting times, and also controls the flow of bags into the handling system \nright from the point of in-put.  \n \n30.3 As the allocated window approaches the desk, the Dispatch conveyor will \nautomatically start up and the bag will be transfered onto the collector conveyor. This \nprocedure is repeated until all bags in a single transaction are released in to the system. \n \n30.4 It is preferential to arrange the conveyor speed such that the bags are fired \nacross the collector conveyor without turning through 900. This encourages the bag to \nlie flat and also decreases the cycle time. Obviously the conveyor width needs to be \ngreater than the maximum bag length.  \n \n31. \nTransfer In feed \u2013 Marked Belt \n \n31.1 In those instances where bags are delivered to the HBS system via a transfer in \nfeed line (or similar) it is much harder to control the input and flow of bags as this is \noperator dependant. \n \n31.2 There should be discipline about the type of bag to be handled and also the \norientation that the bag is placed onto the belt, such that it is in the most stable \norientation for conveying and screening.  \n \n31.3 To help control the flow it is suggested that zones are marked onto the belt to \nindicate where handlers should load bags and where they shouldn\u2019t.  In this way it is \npossible to encourage operators to correctly space bags from the outset, and also the \nthroughput will be limited to be dictated by the belt speed and size of the zone.",
  "26": "32. \nAutomatic Baggage separation \n \n32.1 Whilst bags may be correctly spaced at point of input into the system, by the time \nthey have been conveyed to the screening area, usually via inclines / declines, speed \nchanges, merges / diverges, curves or drop \u2013 over etc bags can quite easily become \nentangled with others. \n \n32.2 Singulation of baggage into the X-ray machine is essential for the efficient \noperation of the 100% HBS system.  Also the correct pitch of baggage entering the \nmachine is important.  For downstream controls to be able to singulate and pitch \nbaggage into the machine correctly each item must be separate and there must be a \ndetectable gap between successive items \u2013 an automated baggage separation \nmechanism is required to achieve this. \n \n32.3 Classically, there are 4 potential baggage patterns that can cause problems and \nhence should be detected and resolved via baggage separation i.e. \nI. Bags caught up with each other, nose to tail, no overlap \nII. Bags partially overlapped, left hand bag leading \nIII. Bags partially overlapped, right hand bag leading \nIV. Bags fully overlapped, i.e. side by side. \n \n32.4 Firstly, a series of sensors are required to detect the above sequence.  Secondly, \na series of queue conveyors, usually with inverter speed control and differing belt types \nare required.  By varying the speed differential between them it is possible to separate \nbaggage in the first 3 sequences above. \n \n32.5 If it is likely that bags can be fully overlapped, then these bags can normally only \nbe separated if they are transferred through at 90 degree T-junction such that they \nnaturally become one of the first 3 sequences instead.  In this case, 2 bag separation \nsystems are to be provided, before and after the 90-degree junction.  These are \nnormally termed `primary\u2019 and `secondary\u2019 baggage separation systems, but are \nfunctionally similar. \n \n33. \nOver\u2013 Height Detection. \n \n33.1 An over \u2013 height detector is required on a queue conveyor prior to the X-ray \nmachine, mainly to prevent damage to the machine and the bag.  Ideally this should be \na mechanical flap with limit switch as these are not too sensitive to straps and labels \netc.  The use of photocells for this is not so efficient.",
  "27": "33.2 If the limit switch on the over height detector trips, then the bag is transported \nonto the next queue conveyor and stopped. \n \n33.3 The oversized bag can now be removed or re-oriented.  A visual warning beacon \nwill flash and an audible alarm will pulse to alert the screening staff.  To re-start the \nconveyor following rectification / removal of the bag the operator shall depress a button \nupon a locally mounted push \u2013 button station. \n \n34. \n Over \u2013 length check \n \n34.1 The length check is performed upon a queue conveyor prior to the X-ray.  This \nensures that bags that are too long are not allowed in the machine. \n \n34.2 Whilst a bag is within the beam of the relevant photocell, pulses are counted from \na star wheel / proximity cell arrangement upon the driven roller of conveyor.  The \nnumber of pulses directly represents the length of the bag, assuming no slippage. \n \n34.3 If the number of pulses received exceeds the pre-set quantity, then the bag is \ndeemed over length.  This rogue bag is allowed (subject to downstream dieback \nconditions) to continue onto the next queue conveyor following the length check and \nstopped.  A visual warning beacon shall flash and an audible alarm pulse to alert the \nscreening staff.  After dealing with the bag the operator presses a `re-start\u2019 push button. \n \n35. \nX-ray screening overview \n \n35.1 Typical operation of screening line \n \n35.1.1 Bags are spaced and pitched correctly prior to delivery into the x-ray machine, \nwhich is integrated into the baggage handling control system.  Each bag is allocated a \nunique code number by the BHS control system to ensure communications between the \nx-ray machines and the BHS control system are always synchronized. \n \n35.1.2 As the bag exits the x-ray machine, the Level 1 decision is made automatically by \nthe x-ray machine indicating whether it is a clear or suspect bag.  If the bag is declared \nas suspicious the X-ray image from the suspect bag will appear at the remote Level 2 \nworkstation to await a manual operator decision.  Typically around 60-70 % of bags will \nbe cleared at this point with the remainder referred to level 2. \n \n35.1.3 The Level 2 x-ray image investigations will be conducted as the bag is being \ntransported along the transport conveyor. This ideally needs to be at least 20 seconds \nfor the level 1 and 2 decision to be made.  The Level 2 decision should be made by the \ntime the bag reaches the decision point, which is usually some form of diverting \nmechanism.  If the operator does not make a decision, the system will automatically \ndefault the bag to the Level 3 screening areas for further analysis.",
  "28": "35.1.4 The diverted bag will allow cleared bags to proceed to the make up area and \nroute suspect bags to the level 3 area for further inspection. \n \n35.1.5 Cleared level 3 or 4 bags are usually entered into the system after the screening \nprocess.  This can either be a manual or automated process. \n \n35.1.6 Suspect bags at this point are referred to Level 4, which is a Security issue \noutside the HBS system. \n \n35.1.7 Tracking errors are a function of both the mechanical system solution, and also \nthe software and commissioning process.  It will not be possible to achieve this target \nrate; if for example, the mechanical system is poorly designed in the first place.  The \nfollowing are guidelines to consider when designing the tracking conveyor systems.  \n \nI. Ideally keep all tracking lines straight and level whenever possible \nII. Avoid changes in direction if possible  \nIII. If unavoidable, use belt curves rather than drop-over 90 degree transfers \nIV. If conveyors cannot be level, then a maximum 7 degree up or down should be \nconsidered \nV. Keep conveying speeds to a minimum to avoid slippage, usually 0.5 to 0.6m/sec  \nVI. Keep speed changes to a minimum  \nVII. Ensure no snagging points on conveyor plate work \nVIII. Careful selection of a diverter type for out sorting to level 3 area \n \n35.2 Tracking Error Rates \n \n35.2.1 The target rate for correct tracking is 99%. Tracking errors are defined as the \npercentage of all bags that are routed to level 3 because tracking information is lost \nsuch that it is no longer possible to securely associate the bag screening decision with \nthe bag. In such cases the bag is routed to level 3 as a fail-safe measure. This error rate \ndoes not make provision for any bags  \nto reach the make up area that have not been specifically cleared by the screening \nprocess. The achievement of this must be 100% \n \n35.2.2 There is however some tracking error causes that are out of the control of the \nsystem and these mainly pertain to baggage types. The following examples are \nintended to illustrate types of baggage induced tracking errors. \n \n35.2.3 Tracking errors result from apparent changes in length or position with respect to \nthe conveyor belt, outside the defined tolerances as detected by photocells and pulse \ngenerators placed on the tracking conveyors.",
  "29": "35.2.4 This is an easily understood way of explaining how baggage characteristics can \ncause movement with respect to the belt, resulting in a tracking error. In this example \nbag 1 that stands on a conveyor on its wheels is likely to move with respect to the belt \nand thus change its position with respect to the belt. The other bag 2 indicates the \npossibility of its progress being interfered with by a protrusion such as a wheel holding \nthe joint between conveyors; this would also move the position of the bag with respect \nto the belt and cause a tracking error  \n \n35.3 Length Change \n \nThe above example illustrate a way in which the length of a bag and the position \nof the bag can appear to change from the perspective of the photocells that detect the \nbaggage  \n \n36. \nBaggage position tracking \n \n36.1 The purpose of baggage tracking is to accurately reconcile routing decisions \nmade by PLC control systems to real baggage travelling upon the conveyors. The \nsoftware solution must provide fail \u2013 safe software philosophies for tracking baggage \nand routine actions whilst also being somewhat tolerant of the unpredictable travel \ncharacteristics inherent when conveying variable baggage types.       \n \n36.2 The bag position tracking technique shall be used for tracking bags on the \nconveyor with data attached to them inside the PLC System. \n \n36.3 Each tracking conveyor is fitted with a pulse generator on a non-driven roller.  \nThe pulse generators generate a pulse per unit of the belt movement on the conveyor. \n \n36.4 When a bag breaks the photocell on the first conveyor, which enters the bag into \nthe tracking model, the bags unique PLC allocated tag is entered into a PLC register.  \nThis happens whilst the bag is obscuring the photocell.  Thus a series of registers are \ncreated at the resolution of the pulse generator, which create a virtual image of the bag.  \nThe pulses received from respective conveyor causes the registers containing the bag \ntag to be moved.  As such through these each tracking conveyor a bag is mapped to its \nown dedicated set of registers and the bag can be seen moving as the conveyor moves. \n \n36.5 This technique allows the bag position to be monitored to the resolution of the \npulse generator that would typically be 50 mm.  Thus when the bag reaches the next \nphotocell on the next conveyor its tracked image should also reach the photocell within \na tolerance.  This allows the tracking of the bag based on its position and is thus \ntolerant of bags being removed without causing a serial error to all succeeding bags.",
  "30": "36.6 In high security applications the registered image also provides a length \nmeasurement of the bag to the resolution of the pulse generator.  This can be used in \naddition to the positional check to give some ability to detect a bag being replaced with \na different bag but of a different length within tolerances. \n \n36.7 This technique gives rise to a degree of certainty of the bag currently at the \nphotocell being the proper bag to which the data in the PLC relates.  This level of \ncertainty is determined by the tolerances. A bag that has moved with respect to the belt \nout side of the set tolerance but which is not within the tolerance of another bag is \nuncertain as to which bag it is. \n \n36.8 A similar concept applies where length check is also used where the position is \nwithin tolerance but the length has changed outside of tolerance. When a bag becomes \nuncertain in this way it is termed as a miss track. Bags that are miss-tracked are \nhandled according to a set default destination for miss-tracked bags. \n \n36.9 This form of tracking control is to be utilized in the security element i.e. the 100% \nHBS. \n \n37. \nBlockage Detection \n \n37.1 Conveyor belt is required to be fitted with a photocell at its discharge end.  For \neach of such conveyors a blockage detection algorithm checks for blockages or bag \njams on the conveyor. \n \n37.2 If the photocell is obscured for longer than a pre- set time period a blockage will \nbe deemed to have occurred.  The timer will not run whilst the conveyors / are stopped. \n \n37.3 In the event of a blockage being detected, the conveyors / affected bag will be \nstopped and an alarm generated on the MIS if fitted. \n \n37.4 The blockage must be manually cleared and the blockage reset function on the \nMIS of MCP operated whereupon the conveyor/s affected by the blockages will restart. \n \n37.5 Conveyors upstream of the blockage will stop under dieback control as baggage \nreaches their respective photocells. \n \n38. \nX-ray HBS Controls and Mechanical system HBS interface \n \n38.1 The purpose of any `HBS\u2019 baggage handling\u2019 software solution is to accurately \nreconcile screening decisions made by connected systems to real baggage travelling \nupon the conveyor.  The solution must provide fail-safe software philosophies for \ntracking baggage, reconciling decisions and routing actions, whilst also being somewhat",
  "31": "tolerant of the unpredictable travel characteristics inherent when conveying variable \nbaggage types. \n \n \n38.2 \nThe very nature of HBS system suggests high accuracy tracking is paramount.  However, \nalthough a control system solution may offer very tight tracking (where the accuracy is + / - one \nscan of the software) in reality baggage is not and cannot be conveyed with such precision 100% \nof time.  With broad tolerances applied to checking routines within the software, the system can \nbecome very tolerant of the conveying inaccuracies.  However, another fundamental feature of \nHBS control systems should be to identify (if possible), tampering with or exchanges of baggage.  \nThis feature requires the application of tight checking tolerances. \n \n38.3 Thus, the situation exists where tighter the tolerances are made to satisfy \n`security\u2019 requirements greater will be the volume of bags rejected as `miss-\ntracks\u2019, conversely, opening up the tolerances will reduce reject rates but will \nreduce the level of security offered.  BHS efficiency is defined in terms of \nacceptable levels of miss-tracks and miss-directs.  In general, the target for this \nshould be in the order of 1 \u2013 2 %.",
