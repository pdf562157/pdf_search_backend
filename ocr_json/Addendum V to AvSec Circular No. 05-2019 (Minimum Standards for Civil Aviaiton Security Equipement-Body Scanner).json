  "5": "Interim Standard Operating Procedure for Full Body Scanner\nat Pre-embarkation Security Checkpoint (PESC)\n\n1, Background - The fast changing geo political scenario and the\ningenuity of the terrorist organizations forces the State authorities to\nregularly update the security apparatus and take additional security\nmeasures to protect Civil Aviation from potential terrorist attacks, including\ndeployment of advanced technologies aimed at detecting threats of varying\ncomplexity. India, as an emerging power, faces a greater threat than ever\nfrom those who would do anything to hamper its growth or tarnish its\nreputation. Therefore, in order to safeguard our airports from the emerging\nthreats, new technologies such as Full Body Scanner (hereinafter referred to\nas FBS) need to be introduced.\n\n2. Current set-up of security equipment at PESC points: There is a\ngood mix of security equipment which is deployed at Pre-embarkation\nSecurity Checkpoint (PESC). The important among them are:\n\ni,DFMD, HHMD\ni, ETD\niii.X-BIS for scanning of cabin baggage (Either Standalone or with\nATRS)\n\nHowever, since the DFMDs (Door Frame Metal Detector) and HHMDs\n(Hand Held Metal Detector), cannot detect non-metallic threats, therefore,\nFull Body Scanner (FBS) is the need of the hour. The Full Body Scanners\ndetect both metallic and non-metallic items concealed on the body under\nclothing. Operation of FBS is based on millimeter waves which detect the\nsignal reflected from the skin or concealed objects, automatically analyses\nthe collected data and displays the final result on a mannequin (generic\noutline) representation.\n\n3. Recommended Layout at PESC: An efficient layout for placing of\nsecurity equipment at PESC would involve a clear and intuitive sequence in\nwhich Door Frame Metal Detectors, Body Scanner and Physical Check\nStations should be placed in such a manner which not only minimizes wait\ntime and congestion, but also incorporates decision points for streamlining\nthe screening process and reducing redundancy.\n\nA recommended sequence along with the functions at the checkpoints\nas well as the decision points is explained in the coming para. The layout for\ndifferent airports may be decided as per the space available at PESC. A\nsample layout is appended as Annexure-\"A\u201d\n\nPage 1 of 8\n",
  "6": "4. Recommended Layout at Setup 1 and screening procedure:\n\na. Pre-Screening: Before screening through body scanner/DFMD, the\npassengers should be instructed to divest all metallic/ non-metallic articles\non their person except necessary apparel for efficient and expeditious\nscreening. An illustrative list of articles to be divested is as below:\n\ni. Shoes, belt, jacket and layers of thick clothing.\nii, Ornaments worn on person as far as practical.\n\niii.\n\nItems such as wallet, keys, watch, pen, mobile phone, electronic\nitems, coins etc.\n\niv. Headgears such as cap etc.\n\n* Note: For Sikh passengers, turban is not required to be divested.\n\nThe airport operator is required to ensure sufficient space and\ndivesting stations in pre-screening area. Further, the Airport operator shall\ndeploy adequate number of divesting assistants in pre-screening area to\nguide the passengers in divesting the necessary items. It is underlined that\nbetter divestment will result in lesser number of unnecessary alarms,\nsmooth screening process and enhanced through put.\n\nb. Officer shall decide and direct the passengers to go through FBS or\ndirectly to the DFMD who cannot be screened through FBS.\n\ni, The passengers who are unwilling to go through the FBS or those who\ncannot be screened through FBS (children having height less than\n1.02 meter, passengers with medical issues and Sikh passengers with\nturban) would, after divesting, go directly to DFMD and then\nmandatorily through frisking booth.\n\nli, The remaining passengers should go through the FBS:\n\nThe security personnel should be deployed in such a manner as to\nregulate the orderly flow of passengers through DFMD, body\nscanner and the frisking booth.\n\nc. Door Frame Metal Detector (DFMD): This is the first point from\nwhich all passengers are required to go through for the screening.\n\n4. Full Body Scanner: The passenger is required to stand in the desired\nposture as per the requirement of particular body scanner. The result\nof body scan is displayed on a generic mannequin, thus protecting the\npassenger's privacy. After screening through FBS, the screener would\ndirect all the passengers to Frisking booth.\n\ni. There should be one male/female certified screener at every FBS\nwho will be placed at the Primary FBS station.\n\nPage 2 of 8\n",
  "7": "ii, Separate mannequins should be selected for male and female\npassengers.\n\ne. FBS Primary Station: At this station (after the FBS), there shall be a\nFBS station manned by an FBS trained male/female screener who\nshall select the appropriate mannequin as per the gender of the\npassenger and instruct the passengers to take the correct posture\ninside FBS. He shall also be responsible for conveying the generic\nintegrated (DFMD+FBS) output image to the relevant frisking booth\n\n5. Recommended Layout at Setup 2 and screening procedure:\n\na. Pre-Sereening: Before screening through body scanner/DFMD, the\npassengers should be instructed to divest all metallic/ non-metallic\narticles on their person except necessary apparel for efficient and\nexpeditious screening.

The result\nof body scan is displayed on a generic mannequin, thus protecting the\npassenger\u2019s privacy. After screening through FBS, the screener would\ndirect the passengers through DFMD, if needed for alarm resolution\nand to the frisking booth.\n\ni, There should be one male/female certified screener at FBS who\nwill be placed at the Primary FBS station. For this purpose,\nthree Secondary FBS stations may be provided against one\nprimary FBS station.\n\nii, Separate mannequins should be selected for male and female\nPassengers.\n\n4. FBS Primary Station: At this station (after the FBS), there shall be a\nFBS station manned by an FBS trained screener who shall select the\nappropriate mannequin as per the gender of the passenger and\ninstruct the passengers to take the correct posture inside FBS.

All the passengers shall be subjected to manual search which\nshall be carried out in accordance with the provisions contained in AVSEC\nCircular No 23/2005. The passenger may be subjected to additional checks\nsuch as Explosive Trace Detector (ETD) or intensive search in a room\nspecially designated for the purpose. If after subjecting a person to manual\nsearch, the screener is still not satisfied, then the person shall be held at the\nScreening point and the supervisor should be informed. The supervisor will\ndecide on further course of action to be taken.\n\n7. \u2014 Responsibility of Airport Operator: It shall be the responsibility of\nthe airport operator to provide sufficient space and infrastructure for\nrepacking stations. Additionally, there should be sufficient space to\naccommodate passengers and personnel, minimizing congestion and wait\ntime. After divesting the items, the passenger is required to be effectively\nscreened before he/she is allowed to proceed to the sterile area. Further, the\nlayout for this sequence should incorporate clear signage and visual\nindicators to direct the passengers to the appropriate screening checkpoints.\nThe layout should be ergonomic and designed to allow for smooth and\nefficient movement of passengers through the screening process.
