As the\narea upto the segregation point is only controlled and not restricted,\nit is quite possible that a person with the intention of harming the\nprotectee gains entry into such areas of terminal.\n\nYou are, therefore, requested to ensure that over and above\nthe protocol officer, two PSOs in plain clothes are detailed with such\npersons for escorting them from the aircraft to the point outside the\nterminal where their own or security provided by the local police\ntakes over. The same procedure should also be followed by us with\nregard to such protectees when they arrive at the terminal for\nboarding the aircraft i.e. for their journey from the eritry point of the\nterminal to the aircraft. It should also be ensured that both the\nprotocol officers as well as the PSOs are in plain clothes. Protocol\nwork should never be done in uniform. CASOs will be personally\nresponsible for compliance of these directions.\n\n90 800890550599999999090990008\n\n2 6. Oe\n(M.S.
