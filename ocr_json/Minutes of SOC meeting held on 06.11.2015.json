In the opening remarks DG expressed that one day is too short a time\nto discuss all the operational and administrative aspects of the\nfunctioning of the Force. However, with a focused agenda we can\nconcentrate on the important issues and come up with solutions\n\nii, DG desired in cases of serious lapse and issues relating to corruot\npractices we need to go to the root of the problem by analysing arid\nconducting detailed inquiries and taking prompt disciplinary action\nagainst the responsible personnel/ officials and also put in place\nremedial measures.\n\n[Action: ADG/APS & All Sector IsG]\n\nili. In view of the concems that certain clients have raised about the\nescalating cost of CISF deployment, it is imperative that we become\ncost effective. We must use integrated technological solutions and\nmove away from man power intensive deployments. We also need to\nrationalize the manpower deployed by using innovative technological\nsolutions. This will ensure that CISF remains viable and also that\nthere will be a sustained long term demand for the Force.\n\n[Action: ADG/APS & All Sector IsG]\n\niv. DG directed to undertake a realistic and rationale exercise to\ndistinguish between core and non-core functions that the CISF at\npresent is performing.
