This will be the trigger mechanism for\ninitiating any mitigation processes by the states agencies.\nFurther in case ofloss/theft ofradioactive sources, the recommended response plan for\nrecovery/retrieval and disposal of the radiological source would be as follow:\nl) \nAERB will inform the crisis Managemenr Group (cMG), DAE through DAE\nEmergency control Room (DAE-ECR), contact Details of 24 x 7 operational DAE-\nEmergency control Rooms are- main DAE-EcR{022-22023979,022-2z02l7l4,Qtiobile)\n09969201364| & alternate DAE *ECR {022-25991070, ozz-zsstszg3, (Mobile)\n099692013651).
