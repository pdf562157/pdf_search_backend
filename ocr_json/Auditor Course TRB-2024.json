As passengers board the aircraft, an ABC gate agent collects boarding cards. The agent then \nenters the passenger\u2019s seat number into the computer system. The computer system identifies the passenger\u2019s name \nfrom the board list and indicates that the passenger has boarded the flight. Prior to closing the flight, the gate agent \npulls up any names remaining on the boarding list and makes a final boarding call for all passengers whose names \nhave not been identified as boarded on the boarding list generated by the computer. Additionally, a flight attendant \non board the aircraft does a head count. According to ABC airlines, baggage belonging to any passenger who has \nnot boarded the flight will be pulled from the aircraft prior to departure. \n \n \nScenario 2 \n \nThe team is observing the perimeter fence located at Erehwon Airport. The team observes that the entire airport \nboundary is fenced. The fence is constructed of chain-link fencing and stands approximately 6 feet in height with three \nstrands of barbed wire out-rigging for a total height of 8 feet. The team notes that the fence appears to be in good \ncondition and there are \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d signs posted at 100-foot intervals (approximately). The team notes that \nthere are no areas observed where the ground has \u201cwashed\u201d out from under the fence leaving gaps; however, on the \nfar west side of the perimeter, the team notes that there are several large trees growing next to the fence on the public \nside of the property. The trees are large enough so that the branches actually hang over the fence. \n \n \nScenario 3 \n \nThe team conducts an interview with the Director of the Airport Permit Administration. The Director explains the \nbackground check procedures implemented by the airport as well as the procedures for ID badge issuance. All \nprocedures appeared to meet the requirements of the NCASP and the ASP. The team did notice that the airport does \nnot inventory badges and according to the Director, it is estimated that approximately 10% of badges had been lost \nor misplaced over the past couple of years. However, as the Director pointed out, the NCASP (and ASP) does not \nrequire airports to inventory ID badges. There are no requirements for re-issuance or revalidation of badges once a \ncertain percentage cannot be accounted for.",

This can make the initial containment actions more manageable and sustainable whilst the investigation to \nget to the causes is underway. \n \nS4 \u2013 Identify and verify root causes \u2013 Identify all applicable causes that could explain why the problem occurred. \nIdentify why the problem was not noticed and for how long it had been occurring. All causes should be validated and \nsupported by evidence. This is where we can use the 5 whys and an Ishikawa to map causes against the effect or \nproblem identified. \n \nS5 \u2013 Define and select permanent corrective actions \u2013 These actions should have a direct relationship to address \nthe root causes identified in S4. Consider risks associated by the corrective actions. \n \nS6 \u2013 Implement permanent corrective actions and check for effectiveness \u2013 Implement the actions and examine \nthem to ensure they are effective.

Staff Gate 1 allows direct access to the SRA from the \nLandside Area of the airport terminal. Further observation revealed no security officers were present to check the ID\u2019s \nof the staff members entering the SRA from this gate. \n \nThe Airport AVSEC Manager (audited party) was immediately notified of the non-compliant situation and the national \nauditor suggested that an AVSEC Officer be stationed at this door. \n \nThe Airport Manager thanked the national auditor for the information and reminded the auditor that this was a new \nprocess with new equipment. He further revealed that the company that sold the equipment is now out of business. \n \nThe auditor noted that the Terminal in which the door is located was currently closed to the public, therefore no \nbreaches of security from the public were observed. \n \n \n \nScenario 2 \n \nDuring the national audit, a visit was made to the Airport Cargo Facility, the national auditor was able to go from the \npublic area of the facility to the security restricted area (warehouse) without being screened or challenged through a \nvacated/vacant office door. \n \nThe Airport AVSEC Manager (audited party) was immediately notified of the non-compliant situation and the door \nwas immediately secured. The Manager advised the auditor that this door was previously under control of an aircraft \noperator, however during the past 6 months, CUSTOMS has taken control/ownership of the office space. \n \n \n \nScenario 3 \n \nPer the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security Programme of the State, each international airport is required to establish a \ndedicated (separate) facility for the operational management of AVSEC emergency situations. (EOC). \n \nDuring the pre-audit review of the Airport Map, the national auditor could not find any indications where the EOC \nwas located. The Airport AVSEC Manager was queried during the opening meeting whereby it was confirmed that \nindeed there was no dedicated EOC.",
