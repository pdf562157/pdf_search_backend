Technical equipment used for the screening of persons and baggage has limitations. Walk-\nthrough metal detectors and hand-held metal detectors, for example, cannot detect non-\nmetallic weapons and explosives and even conventional X-ray equipment has difficulty in\nimaging or defining explosive material effectively. To compensate for such limitations and to\nintroduce a random element into the selection process, an additional manual hand search of\npassengers and cabin baggage is required after being screened by technical means.\n\nv. Selection of cabin baggage for hand search by X-ray operator should always be made using\nthe principle of reasoned selection and in a consistent manner throughout the period cabin\nbaggage is being processed. Reasoned selection means that the selection is based on the X-ray\nimage, concentrating the effort on those bags most likely to conceal a prohibited item.\nRandom selection should be used for hand searching one out of every five persons, besides\nwith those passengers who alarm the technical equipment being used for screening.\n\nvi. It is imperative that the screening of persons and cabin baggage not cease when a single\nweapon or device is detected since multiple weapons, devices or prohibited item can be\npresent on a person or in cabin baggage.\n\nvii. Persons who cannot be cleared by the normal screening process should be referred for manual\nhand-search.

Privacy should be assured when manual hand-search of the person is to be carried out. If\nspecial rooms are not available, portable screens may be used for this purpose. In all cases the\nmanual hand-search of the person should normally be done by an individual of the same\ngender and preferably in the presence of a third party.\n\nix. Individuals must not be permitted to retain any hand-carried items in their possession during\nthe screening of their person and they should be required to divest themselves of all\nextraneous metal, for example, sets of keys, cigarette lighters or mobile/cellular phones, prior\nto being processed for screening.\n\nx.

Baggage originating from places other than airport check-in counters\nshall be protected from the point it is checked-in and screened until it is placed on board an\naircraft.\n\n7.1.2.2. Technical equipment used for the screening of baggage has limitations. Conventional\nX-Ray equipment has difficulty in imaging or defining explosive material effectively. To\ncompensate for such limitation and to introduce a random element into the selection process, an\nadditional manual hand search of hold baggage is required after being screened by technical\nmeans.\n\n7.7.2.3. Selection of hold baggage for hand search by X-ray operator should always be made\nusing the principle of reasoned selection and in a consistent manner throughout the period hold\nbaggage is being processed. Reasoned selection means that the selection is based on the X-ray\nimage, concentrating the effort on those bags most likely to conceal a prohibited/dangerous item.\n\n7.7.2.4. It is imperative that the screening of baggage should not cease when an unauthorized\nsingle weapon or device is detected since multiple weapons, devices or dangerous items can be\npresent in a hold baggage.\n\n7.7.2.5. Hold baggage which cannot be cleared by X-ray screening process should be referred\nfor explosive detection test/manual hand search. Any hold baggage which cannot be\nsatisfactorily cleared by the total screening process inclusive of manual hand search shall be\ndenied loading into the aireraft.\n\n7.7.2.6. In the interest of effective security and passenger facilitation, a manual search of the\nhold baggage should be conducted in accordance with the following basic guidelines:\n\n(@)_ The searcher should be tactful, courteous and use caution.\n\n(b) It is important to adopt a systematic approach so that no items or areas of the bag are\noverlooked.\n\n(\u00a9) Baggage must be matched with the correct person/owner and positioned on the search\ntable so that the owner can open the bag, but not interfere with the conduct of the search.\n\n(@) Items found in baggage which could conceal a prohibited article should be opened or\nsubjected to screening by X-ray or other explosive detection equipment. To increase the\ndetection of prohibited articles such items should be X-rayed alone without extraneous\nclutter.\n\n7.13. \u2014 Screening and clearing of hold baggage\n\n7.7.3.1.
