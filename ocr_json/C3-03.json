  "4": "The manufacturer shall provide one set of CTP per machine for checking \nserviceability of the machine by the operator.  The details of CTP are \nenclosed as per Annex-1. \n \n \n \nANNEXURE - I \n \nCOMBINED TEST PIECE REQUIREMENTS \n \n1. \nSINGLE WIRE RESOLUTION (TEST NO.1) \n \n1.1 \nA set of uninsulated tinned copper wire of size 25 SWG, 30, 35, 38, 40 \nand 42 SWG are placed on a Perspex sheet.  The wires are laid out in S \nshaped curves.  The wires are placed behind varying thickness of \naluminum.  The requirement is to display 38 SWG wire not covered by \nstep wedge.  A tick will indicate the visibility of appropriate wire. Metallic \nmarker should be provided using high density material, so that SWG \nnumbers in the VDU are clearly visible.   \n \n2. \nUSEFUL PENETRATION (TEST NO. 2) \n \n2.1 \nDefines what level of details can be seen behind a thickness of known \nmaterial.  The requirement for this test is that the 24 SWG wire is seen \nunder second step wedge (5/16\u201d). (Note: This is equivalent to FAA, USA \nand DOT UK requirement).  Tick on log sheet will indicate what wires are \nvisible. \n \n3. \nMULTI ENERGY X-RAY (TEST No.3) \n \n3.1 \nWith multi energy X-Ray it should be possible to distinguish between \nmaterials of different average atomic number.  The use of sugar and salt \nsamples encapsulated on the test piece and various materials used in the \nconstruction of CTP will check the material discrimination facility.  A tick \nwill indicate that the sugar / salt samples are shown in different colour. \n \n4. \nSIMPLE PENETRATION (TEST No.4) \n \n4.1. \nThis test defines what thickness of steel the machine should be able to \npenetrate.  The steel step wedge on the CTP has steps of 2 mm from 16 \nmm to 30 mm with a lead strip to check that the machine is above or \nbelow the requirement.   The requirement is that lead is visible beneath 24 \nmm steel.  A tick in log sheet will indicate where a difference between the \nlead strip and the step wedge is visible. \n \n5. \nSPATIAL RESOLUTION (TEST No. 5)",
  "5": "5.1 \nThis test defines the ability of the system to distinguish and display \nobjects, which are close together.  The CTP has 16 copper gratings at \nright angles to each other.  The requirement is that a vertical horizontal \ngrating can be seen.  A tick in the log sheet will indicate that gaps in the \ngratings are visible. \n \n \n6. \nMETHOD: \n \n6.1. \nThe CTP is to be used as a quick routine test carried out daily to \nensure that equipment is working properly and satisfactory image is \nobtained.  The results of the tests should be recorded. \n \n6.2. \nThe CTP should be placed on the belt and passed through the belt \nat least once in a day before the baggage is screened or after the X-Ray \nequipment is switched on to ensure that the equipment is working \nproperly.  If the image is satisfactory the equipment may be used. \n \n6.3. \nThe CTP may be viewed by using image enhancing facility till the \noperator is satisfied that the machine is working properly.  The optimum \nposition of CTP on the belt will depend on X-Ray source and detector \narrangements.  This may be ascertained from the service engineer, if \nneed arises.  \n \n7. \nRESULTS: \n \n7.1 \nThe best results taking both colour and Black & While images into \naccount may be recorded for a particular machine. \n \n7.2 \nThe results of test should be recorded giving information like date, \ntime, machine number and type, supervisors name and other remarks. \n \n7.3 \nSupervisory officer should carry out the tests once in a week and \ncompare the results with daily test sheets.  In case the images are not up \nto the standard, service engineer must be asked to rectify the fault.  The \nmachine may not be used when its performance is in doubt or not \nsatisfactory in the opinion of the supervisor. \n \n7.4 \nThe record mast be kept by the operator for one year after final \nentry.  The records may be checked by the inspecting officers of BCAS \nduring airport inspection and report be submitted to Commissioner of \nSecurity (CA).",

The \nsystem will create a threat object and the same will be superimposed on \nmonitor screen while a bag is being screened.  To acknowledge that the \noperator has seen the false object, operator must press the control panel \nkey that will cause the computer generated threat object to disappear from \nx-rayed bag image on the VDU screen.  Each operator\u2019s action shall be \nrecorded in the hard disc of the computer for the auditing purpose by the \nsupervisor or other authorized person. \n \n2 \nDesign of the system \n \n2.1. \nTIP software should be compatible with other X-ray technologies such as \nautomatic reject unit, Dual X-ray screen technologies, automatic threat \nrecognition system etc.   All X-ray image functions must be available at \nthe same time along with the TIP. \n \n2.2.   Image library \n \n2.2.1. The TIP facility should have an image library containing at least 100 \nexplosive devices, 100 knives and 100 firearms in various sizes, shapes, \nlocations & orientations. However, the system shall have facility to expand \nthe library to incorporate additional images by user without assistance of \nthe manufacturer. \n \n2.2.2 The image library should contain images of threats at different orientations   \n-both plane and end-on orientation should be used.  Although these will \nbe assigned different file names and references, it must be possible to \ncross-reference these as the same threat.

The log - \nin procedure should not take longer than 20 seconds.  The system should \nhave facility to by pass the TIP facility, if programmed so by the system \nadministrator.  It is to be ensured that the TIP software shall not be \nhindrance to normal functioning of X-ray Machines. \n \n2.4.3 When the operator logs - in or logs - out, message should be displayed on \nX-Ray BIS VDU Screen to confirm that he/she has been correctly logged - \nin or logged  - out. \n \n2.5 \nFeed Back Report \n \n2.5.1 The threat image Projection should be capable of giving feedback \u201cHIT, \nMISS or FALSE ALARM\u201d message.  No message will be presented if a \nscreener correctly passed as clear bag. \n \n2.5.2 A\u201dHIT\u201d message to be presented when a screener has correctly identified \na Threat Image Projection image.  A \u201cMISS\u201d message shall be presented \nwhen screener fails to identify the TIP image.  A \u201cFalse Alarm\u201d message \nshall be given when screener incorrectly indicate TIP image when in fact \nno threat image projection is present. The feedback should clearly \nindicate in a screen that a TIP object has been correctly identified / a TIP \nobject has been missed / or no TIP object was present. The information \nshould be recorded in the database.",
  "8": "2.5.3. Different colour coding shall be used for feedback to the Screener.  It is \nrecommended that colour code \u201cRed for MISS\u201d, Green for \u201cHIT\u201d and \nYellow to False Alarm or interrupt\u201d be used. \n \n2.5.4. The system shall automatically prepare the daily log of events for each \nshift and for each Screener performance.
