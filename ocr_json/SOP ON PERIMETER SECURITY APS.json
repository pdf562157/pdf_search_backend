Introduction\nPerimeter security is a vital aspect of aviation security, being a single line of defence, and any\nintrusion will noi only facilitate an intruder direct approach to runway/apron without any\nfurther hindrance wiih potentially disastrous consequences, but also project our motto\n..protection & Security\" in poor light, In the prevailing scenario, there is a constant threat to\ncivil aviation operations. Hence, plotection of aviation operations from unlawful interference is\nof paramount importance and in this regard perimeter security assumes highest significance.\n2. Perimeter Security essentiallv entails:-\n(i). Raising the situational awareness amongst duty personnel about perimeter security duty\nand the responses needed to counter it.\n(ii). Sensitization and training of the duty personnel to anticipate, observe, identify and\nnullify the threat posed from intrusion.\n(iii). Defining the specific action to be taken in perimeter/Apron area in case of perimeter\nintrusion, and procedures for judicious use of weapon, if required, when threat/ intruder\nis spotted in perimeter area & Apron'\n3. Threat Perceotion:\n(i). Intrusion by making hole in perimeter wall.\n(ii). Entry through existing/unnoticed gap in perimeter wall'\n(iii). Entry by scaling over the perimeter wall.",

Ensure below mentioned prescribed security infrastructure for perimeter security at the\nairpoft :-\na. Perimeter wall of prescribed height (B ft) with an overhead fencing of (l 1/zft),\nwith the concertina wire between those wall hangings. In addition, no gaps\nshould be permitted between the wall and the bottom of the concertina coils.\nb. Watch Towers/observation posts should be located at strategic locations having\na clear and an uninterrupted view. Relocation of Watch Towers, keeping in view\nthe density of the adjoining built-up areas, so that there is not much gap\nbetween two Watch Towers in such stretches of the perimeter.\nc. Provision of patrolling track along the perimeter on inside and outside for mobile\nand foot patrolling.\nd. Sufficient illumination of the perimeter area. Wherever sufficient light along the\nperimeter is not available, ensure availability of alternative arrangement by\nissuing torch/dragon lights to all duty personnel.\ne. Provision of authorized number of vehicles for mobile patrolling.\nf. Apart from the existing warning signs displayed on the perimeter wall, the\nCASOs should take up the matter with the concerned Airport Operator for fixing\nthe following warnings, in bold letters, on the perimeter wall to create\npsychological deterrence against any kind of trespass or intrusion:\nNo Trespass.\nStrict action on trespasser.\n01\n02\n03 gstHl q{ sql o.rffi of qrC,ft",

Personnel deployed for perimeter patrolling should not be stationed at\none place only i,e. on watchtower or shelter along the perimeter. Rather, they should\nalso be on the move within their beats'\n(iv). During the night, the mobile patrolling party will carry a dragon light during their\nmovement. They will carry out the checking of all the beats and sentries deployed for\nperimeter guarding. The mobile patrolling will be for re-enforcing the static perimeter\ndeployment. The vihicle provided by the airport operators for patrolling purposes should\nbe used for perimeter patrolling only.\n(v). In case of larger airports, the perimeter can be divided into 2 or 3 or more zones for the\npurpose and each zone will have a separate mobile patrolling party. Mobile patrols\nshould take effective and meaningful rounds and avoid perfunctory patrol of the\nassigned areas.\n(vi). At the time of mounting on duty, watch tower personnel will ensure the condition of\nperimeter wall and fencing adjacent to their watch tower area. Any new development if\nnoticed, will be immediately enquired from the previous sentry and informed to control\nroom and area IC accordinglY,\n(vii).
