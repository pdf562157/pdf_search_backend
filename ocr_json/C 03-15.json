It is observed that\nmany passengers do not carry the cabin baggage tags from the check-in counters and they have\nto come back from security check points to check-in counters again for the same.\n\n2. In view of the above, all airlines operating at a particular airport will also provide\nsufficient cabin baggage tags at the Pre-Embarkation Security Check (PESC) points before\nsereening in order to facilitate the passengers. ASG/APSU will coordinate with airline\noperators so that passengers do not face any problem in getting the cabin baggage tag at the\nPESC points before screening.\n\n(R.N. Dhoke, IPS)\nAddl.
