AS - 43 /2021\n\nSub:- DEPOYMENT OF WELFARE OFFICER IN UNITS UNDER APS\n\nThe realm of airport security is highly sensitive and ever evolving.\nOwing to the continuous dynamic character of airport security, ASG personnel\nare under constant pressure to keep their professionalism fine tuned in\nconsonance with the evolving expectations of this sector, On one hand, the\npersonnel are required to maintain the optimum proficiency & alertness all the\ntimes, on the other, their duty hours are also not constant and at times, even\nstretch beyond normal duty hours. Consequently, the ASG Personnel are\nunable to spend quality time with their families and develop other related\ngrievances. Sometimes, this constant stress also takes a toll on the individual\u2019s\nmental well-being which ultimately affects their social and family life as well,\n\n2. Hence, there is a compelling need to establish a robust welfare\nmechanism to identify and resolve the grievances of ASG personnel. For this, a\nsuitable person be designated as the \u2018Welfare Officer\u2019 to function as the\nbridging block between senior officers and ASG Personnel so that their\ngrievances may be mitigated and they can perform duties focusedly. The\nWelfare Officer will be responsible to interact with CISF personnel regularly\nand to feel their pulse so that they may share their problems whether personal or\nprofessional, if any. It will ensure better working conditions, boost-up the\nmorale of the personnel and help create a professionally cordial atmosphere.\nAlso, it will instil! a feeling of confidence amongst personnel.\n\n03. In view of the above, we have already designated lady officers in various\nunits as welfare officers. This has been done with basically to ensure that while\n\u2018on one hand, they would be in a better position to understand issues being faced\nby lady personnel, on the other hand they can also prove to be an important link\nbetween lady wives of the personnel also.\n\nContd..p/2-\n",

This would, in fact, very adversely affect their morale and their\nlevel of interest in the role of a Welfare Officer.\n\nIn order to create a more robust and representative body to look after\nvarious welfare aspects apart from creating an institution of Welfare Officers,\nevery unit shall also constitute a committee under the chairmanship of CASO\nwith the following composition:-\n\nChairman - CASO\nConvener - Welfare Officer\n(and 3 other members of different ranks as selected by the CASO)\n\nThis committee shall regularly meet and documentize their minutes and\nshall also be in touch with various \u2018Samvad Samitis\u2019 in order to ascertain the\nissues in the minds of the personnel and their families.\n\nTt is expected that the Welfare Officers of the ASGs would function with\nself-motivation & dedication as they have been doing for the last few months\nand the entire committee, including CASO, would support the unit Welfare\nOfficer in all her ventures.\n\n04.
