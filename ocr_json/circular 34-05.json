The screening can be carried out \nbefore, during or after check-in process.   \n \n2.1.2 Airline Operators should ensure that hold baggage is accepted only from \npassengers holding confirmed tickets, and only by a responsible employee or authorized \nrepresentative of the Operator.  Baggage once accepted from a passenger shall be \nprotected from unauthorized access until the time the baggage is returned to the \npassenger at the destination or transferred to another aircraft operator.  Baggage \noriginating from places other than airport check-in counters shall be protected from the \npoint it is checked-in until it is placed on board an aircraft.",
  "2": "2.1.3 Technical equipment used for the screening of baggage has limitations.  \nConventional X-Ray equipment has difficulty in imaging or defining explosive material \neffectively.  To compensate for such limitation or to introduce a random element into the \nselection process, an additional manual hand search of hold baggage is required after \nbeing screened by technical means. \n \n2.1.4 Selection of hold baggage for hand search by X-ray operator should always be \nmade using the principle of reasoned selection and in a consistent manner throughout the \nperiod hold baggage is being processed.  Reasoned selection means that the selection is \nbased on the X-ray image, concentrating the effort on those bags most likely to conceal a \nprohibited/dangerous item.   \n \n2.1.5 It is imperative that the screening of baggage should not cease when an \nunauthorized single weapon or device is detected since multiple weapons, devices or \ndangerous items can be present in a hold baggage. \n \n2.1.6 Hold baggage which cannot be cleared by X-Ray screening process should be \nreferred for explosive detection test/manual hand search.  Any hold baggage which cannot \nbe satisfactorily cleared by the total screening process inclusive of manual hand search be \ndenied loading into the aircraft. \n \n2.1.7 In the interest of effective security and passenger facilitation, a manual search of \nthe hold baggage should be conducted in accordance with the following basic guidelines:- \n \n(a) \nThe searcher should be tactful, courteous and use caution. \n(b) \nIt is important to adopt a systematic approach so that no items or areas of \nthe bag are overlooked. \n(c) \nBaggage must be matched with the correct person/owner and positioned on \nthe search table so that the owner can open the bag, but not interfere with the \nconduct of the search. \n(d) \nItems found in baggage which could conceal a prohibited article should be \nopened or subjected to screening by X-ray or other explosive detection equipment.  \nTo increase the detection of prohibited articles such items should be X-rayed alone \nwithout extraneous clutter. \n \n2.2 \nScreening and clearing of hold baggage \n \n2.2.1 All items of originating accompanied hold baggage shall be screened and cleared \nby one of the following methods:- \n \n(i) \n(a)  100% manual hand search; and  \n \n(b) Screening by X-Ray or Explosive Trace Detection system for items, which \ncannot be adequately cleared by manual hand search. \n \n(ii) \n(a)  100% screening by X-Ray BIS; and",
  "3": "(b) \nManual hand search on a continuous random basis where the percentage of \nbaggage including suspect baggage so searched within a particular period shall not \nbe less than 10% of the total baggage during that period. \n \n(iii) \n(a) 100% screening by X-Ray BIS; and \n \n(b) screening by Explosive Detection System (EDS) unit approved by BCAS, on a \ncontinuous random basis where percentage of bags so screened during a particular \nperiod including suspect baggage shall not be less than 10% of the total baggage \nscreened during that period. \n \n(iv) \n(a)  100% screening with an automatic X-Ray system (level one); and  \n(b) screening by the operator, online or otherwise, of all the bags/items rejected by \nthe system at (a) above (level II);  and  \n(c)  screening of all bags/items rejected at (b) above  with an EDS unit approved by \nBCAS and cleared by the operator using tools of the machine (level III). \n \n(v) \n(a)  100% screening with an EDS unit approved by BCAS; and  \n \n(b)  Manual hand search of all bags/items rejected at (a) above. \n \nNotes: \n \n(A) \nManual hand search will be done in the presence of the relevant passenger. \nSo, in case screening is done after check-in process the passenger will be located \nby the concerned airline operator and required to be present during search of his \nbaggage. \n \n(B) \nIf a bag is not cleared after applying security controls mentioned at serial Nos \n(iii) and (iv) above, it will be subjected to thorough manual hand search in presence \nof the concerned passenger. \n \n(C ) \nIf the passenger is not located, the BDDS and  ASG/ Police will be called by \nthe screener to handle the suspect bag and to take further necessary action as per \nprescribed drill. \n \n(D) \nFirst option as mentioned in para 2.2.1 (i) above will not be available for \ninternational civil commercial flights operation from various airports in India after \n1.1.2006. \n \n2.2.2 Diplomatic bags transported as hold baggage shall be screened in accordance with \nprocedure prescribed vide AVSEC Order No. 2/2002 dated 1.7.2002. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2.3 \nScreening Officers",
