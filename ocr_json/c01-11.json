However, the instructions may be \nsuitably adapted to suit local conditions. Efforts have been made to make the guidelines \ncomprehensive but certain aspects still need proper planning and thinking.  \nSupplementary guidelines shall be issued in due course when changes become \nimperative due to development of new technology and material. \n \n \nUse of IEDs as a low cost-high impact option to create terror and incapacitate the \nsecurity forces has emerged as the general modus operandi of terrorists. Frequent \ncasualties due to such blasts have become a major cause of concern for all. The counter \nIED equipment profile offers technological solutions but they have their limitations. Dogs \nprovide a viable and effective alternative to technology. Sniffer dogs, due to their natural \nsniffing capabilities, have been successful in detection of explosives. \n \n \nHowever, dog is to be used in a professional manner and nurtured well for \noptimum results. Hence, everybody has to understand varied aspects of dog care and \nmaintenance and at the same time provide interface to the force through good \u2018Dog \nHandlers\u2019. Thus, \u2018Dog Squad\u2019 as a whole, consisting of the dog and his handler has to be \nadequately taken care of. Dog Handler should first know his dog and then understand the \nintricacies of \u2018operational environment\u2019 so that the use of dog can be made in best \npossible way for desired end results. \n \n \nHence, keeping the above issues in mind, these guidelines and instructions have \nbeen framed and compiled for the information of everyone involved with the working of \nthe dog squad to enable them to make the best use of the dog squad as an instrument of \nsecurity and for preventing loss of life and property. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(Gurjot Singh Malhi, IPS) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCommissioner of Security (CA)",
  "2": "INTRODUCTION :- \n \n1. \nDogs due to their certain inherent qualities have become an integral and extremely \nuseful tool for the security forces in modern times.  It is known for its extraordinary power \nof sniffing which is almost 100 times that of humans, ultrasonic hearing, natural night \nvision capability and readiness to work under all geo-climatic conditions. It is aggressive, \nalert, loyal, relatively inexpensive and easy to train. \n \n2. \nTo prevent sabotage activities leading to unlawful interference with Civil Aviation \nOperations, by means of placing an explosive device, explosive substances or other such \nmaterial in the aircraft, operational area of the airport, terminal building or any other such \nplace at the airport directly connected with the Civil Aviation Operations or carriage of \nexplosive, explosive device, explosive substances in hand baggage, registered baggage, \ncargo, mails catering items, company stores without prior permission of the competent \nauthority, it is essential to check the above areas, sites, equipments, items etc to detect \nexplosive and explosive substance whenever considered necessary. Following yardsticks \nhave been followed while working out requirement of Dogs, Dog Handlers and Kennel-\nmen for the various Dog Squads being deployed :- \n \n \n(i) \nDog Squad is an integral part of the Bomb Detection and Disposal Squads \n \n(BDDS) and will only move \u201cOn Call\u201d. \n \n \n(ii) \nEach ED team will have 02 Dogs. In addition, separate dogs will be \n \nearmarked for patrolling and surveillance purposes. \n \n \n(iii) \nThe random checks will be of maximum 4 hours in which after every half \n \nhour, rest of 10 minutes will be given to the dogs. The dogs will work in tandem to \n \neach other. \n \n \n(iv) \nAfter each duty of 4 hours, 24 hours rest will be given to dogs.  \n \n \n \n(v) \nOne Kennel-man per 5 Dogs will be the scale of authorization of Kennel-\n \nman. \n \n \n(vi) \nEach dog will have a dedicated Dog Handler. In addition, reserves  have \n \nalso been catered for. \n \n \n \n(vii) \nAirport operator concerned will be responsible for all administrative issues \n \nconcerning the Dog Squad. \n \n \n(vii) \nNo additional dogs have been catered for patrolling purposes at airports \n \nwhere there is only one operational shift.",
  "3": "-2- \n \nBREEDS OF DOGS :- \n \n3. \nIt is recommended that Labrador Retriever, Golden Retriever and Cocker Spaniel \nbe the standard dogs for Dog Squads as they have proven to be the most reliable for ED \nduties in Indian conditions. \n \n4. \nThe following guidelines shall be borne in mind in selecting and procuring the dogs \nfor Dog Squads:- \n \n \n(a) \nPedigree: If possible have a look at the sire as well as the dame.  Do not \n \nmerely go by a certificate. \n \n \n(b) \nPreferably male dogs should be procured. \n \n \n(c) \nBuy pups of 3-6 months age only and not a grown up dog. \n \n \n(d) \nObserve a pup from a distance without disturbing it preferably in whelping \n \narea,  to observe its movement and reaction to your approach. An intelligent pup \n \nwill give a definite reaction to your approach. \n \n \n(e) \nA sound pup should have well developed and proportioned body, with \n \nwell-developed bone, strong back, shiny coat, deep chest and muscular feet \n \nwith well-cushioned foot pad. \n \n \n(f) \nAll limbs should be sturdy, well formed and graceful. \n \n \n(g) \nLook out for faults such as bend in feet, poor shoulder placement, lack of \n \nco-ordination in limbs or a body configuration. \n \n \n(h) \nDo not select pups with running nose and eyes.  It may indicate distemper \n \ndisease. Keep such pups under observation for a month before they are \n \npurchased. \n \n \n(i) \nA Pup with enlarged tummy is generally suffering from malnutrition or from \n \npoorly managed kennels. \n \n \n(j) \nExamine its mouth for overshot/undershot jaw. \n \n \n(k) \nCoat should be shining and free from rashes. Harsh and dull skin indicates \n \npoor health as well as skin ailment. \n \n \n(l) \nEyes should be clear and bright. The nose and mouth should be according \n \nto breed specifications. \n \n \n(m) \nEars should be clean and odourless. \n \n \n(n) \nThe Pup should give an impression of being vigorous, sensitive, \n \nintelligent, energetic, aggressive and not timid or excitable.",

  "8": "-7- \n \n16. \nDaily Operation Drills shall include:- \n \n \n \n \n(a) \nRefresh his sniffing power through explosive samples. Standard list of \nexplosives for training is given at Paragraph 24 which should be procured and kept \nby each Dog Squad. \n \n \n(b) \nUndertake simulated exercise to detect different explosives being used by \n \nterrorist groups in the country.  \n \n \n(c) \nMake him undergo warm up exercises to enhance his stamina in the form \n \nof jumping, running, sniffing etc. \n \n \n(d) \nSubject him to special movements like crawling, rolling, side movements \n \netc. \n \n \n \n(e) \nPat the dog after it has successfully performed a task/exercise. \n \n17. \nGROOMING OF DOGS \n \n \nThe actual cleaning of the coat and skin is done with the help of brush and steel \ncomb.  First, the dog is given a vigorous massage with the tip of the fingers.  This brings \nout the hidden dust, loosens the broken hair and stimulates the blood circulation of the \nskin.  Then the coat is brushed with a body brush in a circular manner and then in the \ndirection of the hair.  After this a steel comb is used to remove the dead and tangled hair. \nComb is also useful in untangling the matted hair. Finally, the dogs are massaged \nvigorously with the flat of the palm to give a shiny and glossy appearance.  This also sets \nthe hair.  During the grooming period, following organs are attended to as follows:- \n \n \n(a) \nEyes:- \nDischarge, when present, should be removed with clean         \n \ncotton soaked in warm water. Eye lotions, unless specifically prescribed by a \n \nveterinary officer, should not be used.  If any symptoms of infection or injury are \n \nnoted, for example weeping or opacity, the dog must be taken for examination and \n \ntreated by a veterinary doctor. \n \n \n(b) \nTeeth:- \nNormally the teeth of the dog require very little attention.  \n \nDiscoloured or stained teeth may be cleaned with a weak solution of hydrogen \n \nperoxide once a month.  Should the accumulation of tartar be excessive, it may be \n \nnecessary to scale them from time to time. \n \n \n(c) \nEars :- \nThe daily inspection and cleaning of the ears is most \n \nimportant.  The accumulation of wax and dirt can, especially in long eared dogs, \n \ncause severe inflammation and  irritation.  Wax and dirt are best removed with the \n \naid of cotton wool, either dry or soaked in warm water.  Although the eardrum of a \n \ndog is well protected from injury, care should be taken when cleaning deep down \n \nin the ear canal as this can cause considerable discomfort to the dog.",
  "9": "-8- \n \n \n(d) \nNails :- \nWith regular exercise, nails requires little attention.  However, \n \nthey must be watched for over growth. Overgrown nails must be trimmed, as, if \n \nleft, they will split and cause lameness. Only a properly trained person should do \n \ntrimming, as excessive cutting will produce lameness. The dewclaws (rudimentary \n \nfirst digit) serve no useful purpose and can be removed surgically by a veterinary \n \nsurgeon. \n \n \n(e) \nAnus :- \nRegular inspection of the anal sphincter is required to see if \n \nany segments of tapeworms are sticking or protruding.  Regular watch is also kept \n \nto see if anal glands are impacted. The anal sphincter and anal glands \n \nlubricate the passage of stool. The anal glands are normally prevented from \n \ngetting impacted by the process of defecation. However, if they are impacted, a \n \npiece of cotton wool is placed over the anus and firm pressure is applied with the \n \nfore finger and thumb which relieves the impaction. \n \n18. \nBENEFITS OF GROOMING :- \n \n \n(a) \nHidden wounds are exposed. \n \n \n(b) \nTicks/fleas can be removed. \n \n \n(c) \nIncreases the blood circulation. \n \n \n(d) \nMinimizes fatigue. \n \n \n(e) \nEnhances coat quality. \n \n \n(f) \nLoose hair is shed off. \n \n \n(g) \nDog looks attractive. \n \n \n(h) \nIncreases the affection between dog and handler. \n \n19. \nTICK CONTROL:- \n \n \n(a) \nBeing transmitters of piroplasmosis, control of ticks is of vital  importance. \n \nTicks are blood-sucking parasites, which attach themselves to the skin for varying \n \nperiod of time. If numerous they can be very irritating to the dog causing \n \nrestlessness and subsequent loss of concentration. Heavy infestation may \n \nalso result in anemia. \n \n \n(b) \nDuring grooming and on dogs return from exercise, dogs should be \n \nthoroughly \u201cde-ticked\u201d. Ticks are most frequently found around the head, \n \nespecially in the ears, the fold of the earflap, between the toes and to a lesser \n \ndegree on other parts of the body.  Great care must be exercised in their removal, \n \nif roughly pulled, the head may remain embedded in the skin with results in \n \nabscess formation. They are best removed with help of forceps. However, with \n \ncare and practice they can be removed quite efficiently with the fore finger and \n \nthumb.  Once removed, they should be placed in a container containing kerosene \n \nand burnt when the operation is completed.",
  "10": "-9- \n \n \n(c) \nAll vegetation within 3 to 4 meters of the kennel must be cleaned by \n \nburning. In areas where fire risk exists , liquid insecticides can be  sprayed on the \n \nvegetation .The kennels themselves must be regularly disinfected with particular \n \nattention being paid to crevices and cracks in the concrete floor and walls.  \n \nBlowlamp is  found to be of good value in dealing with these sites. \n \n20. \nBATHING :- \n \n \n(a) \nA dog should be bathed as infrequently as possible. \n \n \n(b) \nThe skin of the dog is rich in grease glands.  Frequent bathing removes this \n \nnatural grease resulting in dry skin with accompanying irritation and also gives a \n \nharsh appearance. \n \n \n(c) \nIf it is necessary to bathe a dog, warm, but not hot water should be \n \nused; the temperature should not exceed 1000 F.  Care must be taken to prevent \n \nsoap and water from entering the eyes and ears.  This can be avoided by plugging \n \nears  with cotton wool. As the skin of the dog is very sensitive, only bland soaps \n \nshould be used. Carbolic soaps, if applied direct to the body, cause severe \n \nirritation. After the dog has been  washed, the coat must be thoroughly rinsed \n \nto remove all traces of soap and dried with towel. \n \n21. \nCLIPPING :- \n \n \n \nClipping of hair is never practiced in a Dog except where recommended by  \n \na veterinary officer. However, trimming of hair of heavy coated dog may be \n \npracticed during summer. \n \n22. \nHANDLING AND RESTRAINT \n \nAn ailing or injured dog is apt to bite anyone handling it, either because it is in pain, \nis afraid or not fully aware of its actions. For this reason, care must be  \ntaken in \nhandling and the animal must be restrained to prevent it from biting.  The  dog \nshould be approached and handled calmly, confidently, quietly, firmly and \ndeliberately but with sympathy and understanding.  It is usually preferable to allow \nthe dog to see one approaching and to let it realize that; the leash being kept \nsufficiently tight to prevent the dog from running away.  The dog should  \nthen be \nmuzzled, or its mouth should be taped, while the assistant holds the head. To         \n\u2018tape\u2019  a dog, a piece of bandage, or other material, about three feet long and three \ninches wide, is required.  Make an ordinary single loop in the middle of the \nbandage and slip this loop over the muzzle with the twist on upper side. Pull this \ntight enough to prevent the dog from opening its mouth, cross the bandage below \nthe jaw, and then carry the ends below the ears and tie at the back of the neck.  If \nthe dog is inclined  to slip the loop, it may be slipped over the muzzle while \nholding the bandage so that the hands are safe.  If the dog is behaving awkwardly, \na strong handler should seize it by the scruff of the neck, with one hand on each \nside, and place the dogs body between his legs. The animal can then be firmly \nheld and muzzled or taped.",
  "11": "-10- \n \n23. \nACTIONS TO BE TAKEN WHEN THE DOG SUSTAINS INJURY OR BECOMES \n \nEXHAUSTED \n \n \n(a) \nStop further progress/movement of the dog. Carry it to shade/shelter and \n \nkeep the dog in complete rest and check the temperature. Offer water with \n \nelectoral/glucose powder. Put a tourniquet in proximity to the wound in case of \n \nsevere bleeding and apply antiseptic ointment/powder after cleaning the wound \n \nand applying tincture benzene to arrest bleeding. Then, put on a bandage with \n \nsufficient cotton padding. \n \n \n(b) \nIn case of fractures, the affected portion may be immobilized by tying splints \n \nover cotton/cloth padding and then the animal may be evacuated by fastest \n \npossible means to nearest Veterinary Hospital for necessary treatment. \n \n \n(c) \nIn case of snakebite, a tourniquet may be applied in proximity to the wound \n \nimmediately and sufficient pressure should be applied for proper bleeding and \n \nwashing out of the poison. The wound may be washed with soap and flushed with \n \nlarge quantity of water and antibiotic cream should be applied later. \n \n \n(d) \nAfter sustaining an injury/during sickness, the  animal should not be allowed \n \nto walk; it may either be carried in arms or in stretcher, which can be easily made \n \nby two poles tied on both sides of ground sheet/durries IT. \n \n \n(e) \nIn case of gun shot wounds, action may be taken as mentioned above as \n \nthe animal may be immobile. In case of fracture, gun shot wounds or severe \n \ninjuries, Morphine/Pethidine can be given, to keep the animal quiet and free from \n \npain. \n \n \n(f) \nIn case of heat stroke and dehydration, the dog may be carried to shade \n \nand given sufficient drinking water.  If the body temperature is very high, cold water \n \nmay be poured over the body or cloth dipped in cold water may be wrapped \n \naround the animal.  The dog must be given complete rest and permitted to drink as \n \nmuch water as it can in frequent intervals during evacuation. \n \n \n(g) \nIn case of sprain/contusion, the affected part may be cooled by pouring cold \n \nwater/wrapping in cloth dipped in cold water and kept immobilized. \n \n \n(h) \nWhen the dogs are given full feed, at least half an hour rest may be given \n \nbefore proceeding on employment.  If time does not permit, they may be  fed only \n \nlight feed, which may be repeated as required.
