  "1": "FLAG  CODE  OF   INDIA\n  \n  \n            The Indian National Flag represents the hopes and aspirations of the people of India. It is the\nsymbol of our national pride. Over the last five decades, several people including members of armed\nforces have ungrudgingly laid down their lives to keep the tricolour flying in its full glory.   \n  \n            The significance of the colours and the chakra in the National Flag was amply described by\nDr. S. Radhakrishnan in the Constituent Assembly which unanimously adopted the National Flag.  \nDr. S. Radhakrishnan explained\u2014\u201cBhagwa or the saffron colour denotes renunciation of\ndisinterestedness.  Our leaders must be indifferent to material gains and dedicate themselves to their\nwork.  The white in the centre is light, the path of truth to guide our conduct.  The green shows our \nrelation to soil, our relation to the plant life here on which all other life depends.  The Ashoka Wheel \nin the center of the white is the wheel of the law of dharma.  Truth or satya, dharma or virtue ought to \nbe the controlling principles of those who work under this flag.  Again, the wheel denotes motion.  \nThere is death in stagnation.  There is life in movement.  India should no more resist change, it must \nmove and go forward.   The wheel represents the dynamism of a peaceful change.\u201d \n  \n            There is universal affection and respect for, and loyalty to, the National Flag. Yet, a\nperceptible lack of awareness is often noticed, not only amongst people but also in the\norganisations/agencies of the government, in regard to laws, practices and conventions that apply to\nthe display of the National Flag. Apart from non-statutory instructions issued by the Government \nfrom time to time, display of the National Flag is governed by the provisions of the Emblems and\nNames (Prevention of Improper Use) Act, 1950 (No.12 of 1950) and the Prevention of Insults to\nNational Honour Act, 1971 (No. 69 of 1971). Flag Code of India, 2002 is an attempt to bring together\nall such laws, conventions, practices and instructions for the guidance and benefit of all concerned. \n  \n            For the sake of convenience, Flag Code of India, 2002, has been divided into three parts. Part I\nof the Code contains general description of the National Flag. Part II of the Code is devoted to the\ndisplay of the National Flag by members of public, private organizations, educational institutions, etc.\nPart III of the Code relates to display of the National Flag by Central and State governments and their\norganisations and agencies. \n  \n            Flag Code of India, 2002, takes effect from January 26, 2002 and supersedes the \u2018Flag Code \u2013\nIndia\u2019 as it existed.  \n  \n. \nPART   I \nGENERAL \n  \n1.1       The  National Flag shall be a tri-colour panel made up of three rectangular panels or sub-",
  "2": "panels of equal widths. The colour of the top panel shall be India saffron (Kesari) and that of the\nbottom panel shall be India green. The middle panel shall be white, bearing at its centre the design of\nAshoka Chakra in navy blue colour with 24 equally spaced spokes. The Ashoka Chakra shall\npreferably be screen printed or otherwise printed or stenciled or suitably embroidered and shall be\ncompletely visible on both sides of the Flag in the centre of the white panel. \n  \n1.2       The National Flag of India shall be made of hand spun and hand woven wool/cotton/silk  \nkhadi bunting. \n  \n1.3       The National Flag shall be rectangular in shape. The ratio of the length to the height  (width) \nof the Flag shall be 3:2. \n  \n1.4       The standard sizes of the National Flag shall be as follows:- \n  \n1.5       An appropriate size should be chosen for display. The flags of 450X300 mm size are intended\nfor aircrafts on VVIP flights, 225X150 mm size for motor-cars and 150X100 mm size for table flags. \n  \nPART  II \n  \nHOISTING/DISPLAY/USE OF NATIONAL FLAG BY MEMBERS OF PUBLIC,  PRIVATE \nORGANISATIONS, EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS, ETC. \n  \n                         \nSECTION I \n  \n  \n2.1       There  shall  be  no  restriction  on  the  display  of  the  National Flag  by members of \ngeneral public,  private organizations,  educational  institutions, etc.,  except  to the extent  \nprovided  in  the Emblems  and  Names  (Prevention of  Improper Use)  Act, 1950*  and  \n  \n  \n  \n  \nFlag Size No. \nDimensions in mm \n  \n1 \n6300  X  4200 \n  \n2 \n3600  X  2400 \n  \n3 \n2700  X  1800 \n  \n4 \n1800  X  1200 \n  \n5 \n1350  X  900 \n  \n6 \n900  X  600 \n  \n7 \n450  X  300 \n  \n8 \n225  X  150 \n  \n9 \n150  X  100",
