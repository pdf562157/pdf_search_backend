  "24": "22\n \n \nAppendix `F\u2019 \n \nSPECIFICATION FOR ON-LINE X-RAY \nBAGGAGE SCREENING SYSTEM \n \n \n1. \nINTRODUCTION \n \nThe existing X-Ray machines installed at check in area to screen registered \nbaggage are in stand-alone mode and not capable of detecting 100% explosives. \nStand-alone machines occupy space at departure lounges and also cause big \nqueues, which disrupt passenger flow during peak hours. Keeping in view the \nsecurity threat, it is desirable that multi level in-line detection system is installed at \nmajor airports. The multi level X-Ray screening system has already been installed at \nvarious international airports abroad. The online hold baggage handling system \n(HBS) shall be integrated with airport baggage handling in order to provide complete \nhold baggage processing and screening system. It is recommended that installation \nof hold baggage screening system and X-ray BIS conveyer belt may be integrated \nand the work awarded as turn key project. Depending upon the passengers\u2019 peak \nhour density the level may be varied from three to four. Initially on line hold baggage-\nscreening system shall be introduced at Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata, \nAhmedabad, Calicut, Varanasi, Amritsar, Vizag and Srinagar airports. All new \nterminals and airports constructed in future will have only HBS. The priority of \ninstallation  of HBS shall be decided by AAI in consultation with BCAS. \n \n2. \nConceptual System Design \n \nThe system designed for multi level screening process shall have the \nfollowing features: - \n \n2.1 \nLevel 1 \n \nLevel 1 screening is to be undertaken by a high speed multi view / computer \nsliced X-ray machine with automatic explosives detection facilities. The decision is to \nbe fully automatic and the operator intervention is only required in start-up and shut \ndown procedures. Un-cleared baggage will go to Level 2, and cleared bags will \nproceed to the baggage make-up area. \n \n2.2 \nLevel 2 \n \n2.2.1 Level 2 screening is remote workstations(s) whereby operator(s) can analyze \nthe image generated by the Level 1 X-ray machine. The works tation is required to be \nequipped with enhanced imaging / manipulation systems to assist operator to \ndiagnoses the screened image. \n \n2.2.2 Typically 30-40% of all level-1 screened bags would be referred to level 2. \n \n \nContd\u202623",
  "25": "23\n \n2.2.3 Whilst the bag is being referred to level 2, it should be \u2018tracked\u2019 while it travels \nalong the length of the conveyor such that its position and identity is known at all \ntimes. \n \n2.2.4 In practice, it is usual to provide a conveying system that allows 15-20 \nseconds to queue and process the level 2 images.  \n \n2.2.5 In case of bigger airports (higher passenger density airport), a workstation 2B \nshall be introduced for longer time analysis. In this instance, there will be enhanced \nimage manipulation capabilities; usually a more senior / experienced operator will \nview the image.  In addition, the Level 2B screening would not be subject to time \nconstraints as for level 2A. The analysis may be carried out between 40 to 120 \nseconds and 98% bags are expected to be cleared. \n \n2.2.6 In systems with multiple level 1 machines, the Matrix type set-up of several \nlevel 1 and level 2 workstations will be linked together, enabling the next un-cleared \nlevel 1 image to go to next available level-2 workstation.  The matrix data \ncommunication shall enable any of the Level 1 X-ray systems to send rejected bag \nimages to any of the Level 2 workstations. The proposed matrix scheme must be \nflexible enough to accommodate future expansion. In all cases, any bag considered \nsuspect by the operator are to be flagged and routed automatically to Level 3. \n \n2.2.7 Cleared bags shall proceed to the baggage make-up area. \n \n2.2.8 Any bag not cleared within a pre-determined time by the level 2 operators, are \nconsidered \u2018time-outs\u2019 and automatically forwarded to level 3. In addition any miss-\ntracked bags on the conveying system are defaulted to the level 3 area. \n \n2.3 \nLevel 3 \n \n2.3.1 There are several technologies available for level 3 screening, and the \nselection usually depends upon BCAS regulations and / or budget constraints. These \ninclude: \n \n2.3.2 Explosive Trace / Particle detection Check. The un-cleared / suspected \nbags shall be checked with latest explosive trace detectors by using vacuum pump / \nspecially designed filter papers for checking the presence of explosive substances.  \n \n2.3.3 Explosive Sniffer Dogs.  The dogs being the most reliable explosive \ndetection system, it is recommended that rejected bag at level 2 be sniffed by \nExplosive Detection dogs. The dogs to be deployed in pair, one for initial sniffing and \nsecond for confirmation. The pair of dogs\u2019 to be turned over every one hour. In an 8-\nhour shift, there should be minimum 4 dogs with handlers. \n \n \nContd\u202624",

This reduces \npassenger-waiting times, and also controls the flow of bags into the handling system \nright from the point of in-put.  \n \n30.3 As the allocated window approaches the desk, the Dispatch conveyor will \nautomatically start up and the bag will be transferred onto the collector conveyor. \nThis procedure is repeated until all bags in a single transaction are released in to the \nsystem. \n \n30.4 It is preferential to arrange the conveyor speed such that the bags are fired \nacross the collector conveyor without turning through 900. This encourages the bag \nto lie flat and also decreases the cycle time. Obviously the conveyor width needs to \nbe greater than the maximum bag length.  \n \nContd\u202636",
  "38": "36\n31. \nTransfer In feed \u2013 Marked Belt \n \n31.1 In those instances where bags are delivered to the HBS system via a transfer \nin feed line (or similar) it is much harder to control the input and flow of bags as this \nis operator dependant. \n \n31.2 There should be discipline about the type of bag to be handled and also the \norientation that the bag is placed onto the belt, such that it is in the most stable \norientation for conveying and screening.  \n \n31.3 To help control the flow it is suggested that zones are marked onto the belt to \nindicate where handlers should load bags and where they shouldn\u2019t.  In this way it is \npossible to encourage operators to correctly space bags from the outset, and also \nthe throughput will be limited to be dictated by the belt speed and size of the zone. \n \n32. \nAutomatic Baggage separation \n \n32.1 Whilst bags may be correctly spaced at point of input into the system, by the \ntime they have been conveyed to the screening area, usually via inclines / declines, \nspeed changes, merges / diverges, curves or drop \u2013 over etc bags can quite easily \nbecome entangled with others. \n \n32.2 Singulation of baggage into the X-ray machine is essential for the efficient \noperation of the 100% HBS system.  Also the correct pitch of baggage entering the \nmachine is important.  For downstream controls to be able to singulate and pitch \nbaggage into the machine correctly each item must be separate and there must be a \ndetectable gap between successive items \u2013 an automated baggage separation \nmechanism is required to achieve this. \n \n32.3 Classically, there are 4 potential baggage patterns that can cause problems \nand hence should be detected and resolved via baggage separation i.e. \nI. Bags caught up with each other, nose to tail, no overlap \nII. Bags partially overlapped, left hand bag leading \nIII. Bags partially overlapped, right hand bag leading \nIV. Bags fully overlapped, i.e. side by side. \n \n32.4 Firstly, a series of sensors are required to detect the above sequence.  \nSecondly, a series of queue conveyors, usually with inverter speed control and \ndiffering belt types are required.  By varying the speed differential between them it is \npossible to separate baggage in the first 3 sequences above. \n \n32.5 If it is likely that bags can be fully overlapped, then these bags can normally \nonly be separated if they are transferred through at 90 degree T-junction such that \nthey naturally become one of the first 3 sequences instead.  In this case, 2 bag \nseparation systems are to be provided, before and after the 90-degree junction.  \nThese are normally termed `primary\u2019 and `secondary\u2019 baggage separation systems, \nbut are functionally similar. \n \nContd..37",

Ideally this should \nbe a mechanical flap with limit switch as these are not too sensitive to straps and \nlabels etc.  The use of photocells for this is not so efficient. \n \n \n33.2 If the limit switch on the over height detector trips, then the bag is transported \nonto the next queue conveyor and stopped. \n \n33.3 The oversized bag can now be removed or re-oriented.  A visual warning \nbeacon will flash and an audible alarm will pulse to alert the screening staff.  To re-\nstart the conveyor following rectification / removal of the bag the operator shall \ndepress a button upon a locally mounted push \u2013 button station. \n \n34. \n Over \u2013 length check \n \n34.1 The length check is performed upon a queue conveyor prior to the X-ray.  \nThis ensures that bags that are too long are not allowed in the machine. \n \n34.2 Whilst a bag is within the beam of the relevant photocell, pulses are counted \nfrom a star wheel / proximity cell arrangement upon the driven roller of conveyor.  \nThe number of pulses directly represents the length of the bag, assuming no \nslippage. \n \n34.3 If the number of pulses received exceeds the pre-set quantity, then the bag is \ndeemed over length.  This rogue bag is allowed (subject to downstream dieback \nconditions) to continue onto the next queue conveyor following the length check and \nstopped.

Each bag is \nallocated a unique code number by the BHS control system to ensure \ncommunications between the x-ray machines and the BHS control system are \nalways synchronized. \n \n35.1.2 As the bag exits the x-ray machine, the Level 1 decision is made \nautomatically by the x-ray machine indicating whether it is a clear or suspect bag.  If \nthe bag is declared as suspicious the X-ray image from the suspect bag will appear \nat the remote Level 2 workstation to await a manual operator decision.

This ideally needs to be at \nleast 20 seconds for the level 1 and 2 decision to be made.  The Level 2 decision \nshould be made by the time the bag reaches the decision point, which is usually \nsome form of diverting mechanism.  If the operator does not make a decision, the \nsystem will automatically default the bag to the Level 3 screening areas for further \nanalysis. \n \n35.1.4 The diverted bag will allow cleared bags to proceed to the make up area and \nroute suspect bags to the level 3 area for further inspection. \n \n35.1.5 Cleared level 3 or 4 bags are usually entered into the system after the \nscreening process.  This can either be a manual or automated process. \n \n35.1.6 Suspect bags at this point are referred to Level 4, which is a Security issue \noutside the HBS system. \n \n35.1.7 Tracking errors are a function of both the mechanical system solution, and \nalso the software and commissioning process.  It will not be possible to achieve this \ntarget rate; if for example, the mechanical system is poorly designed in the first \nplace.  The following are guidelines to consider when designing the tracking \nconveyor systems.  \n \nI. Ideally keep all tracking lines straight and level whenever possible \nII. Avoid changes in direction if possible  \nIII. If unavoidable, use belt curves rather than drop-over 90 degree transfers \nIV.

Keep speed changes to a minimum  \nVII. Ensure no snagging points on conveyor plate work \nVIII. Careful selection of a diverter type for out sorting to level 3 area \n \n35.2 Tracking Error Rates \n \n35.2.1 The target rate for correct tracking is 99%. Tracking errors are defined as the \npercentage of all bags that are routed to level 3 because tracking information is lost \nsuch that it is no longer possible to securely associate the bag screening decision \nwith the bag. In such cases the bag is routed to level 3 as a fail-safe measure. This \nerror rate does not make provision for any bags  \nto reach the make up area that have not been specifically cleared by the screening \nprocess. The achievement of this must be 100%. \n \n35.2.2 There is however some tracking error causes that are out of the control of the \nsystem and these mainly pertain to baggage types. The following examples are \nintended to illustrate types of baggage induced tracking errors. \n \n35.2.3 Tracking errors result from apparent changes in length or position with respect \nto the conveyor belt, outside the defined tolerances as detected by photocells and \npulse generators placed on the tracking conveyors.",
  "41": "39\n \n35.2.4 This is an easily understood way of explaining how baggage characteristics \ncan cause movement with respect to the belt, resulting in a tracking error. In this \nexample bag 1 that stands on a conveyor on its wheels is likely to move with respect \nto the belt and thus change its position with respect to the belt. The other bag 2 \nindicates the possibility of its progress being interfered with by a protrusion such as a \nwheel holding the joint between conveyors; this would also move the position of the \nbag with respect to the belt and cause a tracking error  \n \n35.3 Length Change \n \nThe above example illustrate a way in which the length of a bag and the \nposition of the bag can appear to change from the perspective of the photocells that \ndetect the baggage  \n \n \n \n36. \nBaggage position tracking \n \n36.1 The purpose of baggage tracking is to accurately reconcile routing decisions \nmade by PLC control systems to real baggage travelling upon the conveyors. The \nsoftware solution must provide fail \u2013 safe software philosophies for tracking baggage \nand routine actions whilst also being somewhat tolerant of the unpredictable travel \ncharacteristics inherent when conveying variable baggage types.       \n \n36.2 The bag position tracking technique shall be used for tracking bags on the \nconveyor with data attached to them inside the PLC System. \n \n36.3 Each tracking conveyor is fitted with a pulse generator on a non-driven roller.  \nThe pulse generators generate a pulse per unit of the belt movement on the \nconveyor. \n \n36.4 When a bag breaks the photocell on the first conveyor, which enters the bag \ninto the tracking model, the bags unique PLC allocated tag is entered into a PLC \nregister.  This happens whilst the bag is obscuring the photocell.  Thus a series of \nregisters are created at the resolution of the pulse generator, which create a virtual \nimage of the bag.  The pulses received from respective conveyor causes the \nregisters containing the bag tag to be moved.  As such through these each tracking \nconveyor a bag is mapped to its own dedicated set of registers and the bag can be \nseen moving as the conveyor moves. \n \n36.5 This technique allows the bag position to be monitored to the resolution of the \npulse generator that would typically be 50 mm.  Thus when the bag reaches the next \nphotocell on the next conveyor its tracked image should also reach the photocell \nwithin a tolerance.  This allows the tracking of the bag based on its position and is \nthus tolerant of bags being removed without causing a serial error to all succeeding \nbags. \n \n \nContd..40",
  "42": "40\n36.6 In high security applications the registered image also provides a length \nmeasurement of the bag to the resolution of the pulse generator.  This can be used \nin addition to the positional check to give some ability to detect a bag being replaced \nwith a different bag but of a different length within tolerances. \n \n36.7 This technique gives rise to a degree of certainty of the bag currently at the \nphotocell being the proper bag to which the data in the PLC relates.  This level of \ncertainty is determined by the tolerances. A bag that has moved with respect to the \nbelt out side of the set tolerance but which is not within the tolerance of another bag \nis uncertain as to which bag it is. \n \n36.8 A similar concept applies where length check is also used where the position \nis within tolerance but the length has changed outside of tolerance. When a bag \nbecomes uncertain in this way it is termed as a miss track. Bags that are miss-\ntracked are handled according to a set default destination for miss-tracked bags. \n \n36.9 This form of tracking control is to be utilized in the security element i.e. the \n100% HBS. \n \n37. \nBlockage Detection \n \n37.1 Conveyor belt is required to be fitted with a photocell at its discharge end.  For \neach of such conveyors a blockage detection algorithm checks for blockages or bag \njams on the conveyor. \n \n37.2 If the photocell is obscured for longer than a pre- set time period a blockage \nwill be deemed to have occurred.  The timer will not run whilst the conveyors / are \nstopped. \n \n37.3 In the event of a blockage being detected, the conveyors / affected bag will be \nstopped and an alarm generated on the MIS if fitted. \n \n37.4 The blockage must be manually cleared and the blockage reset function on \nthe MIS of MCP operated whereupon the conveyor/s affected by the blockages will \nrestart. \n \n37.5 Conveyors upstream of the blockage will stop under dieback control as \nbaggage reaches their respective photocells. \n \n38. \nX-ray HBS Controls and Mechanical system HBS interface \n \n38.1 The purpose of any `HBS\u2019 baggage handling\u2019 software solution is to \naccurately reconcile screening decisions made by connected systems to real \nbaggage traveling upon the conveyor.
