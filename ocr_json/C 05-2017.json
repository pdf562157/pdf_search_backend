Introduction \n \nThe Perimeters at the Indian Airports mainly consist of a Perimeter wall of 8 ft. high with a \nconcertina coil overhang of 1 and \u00bd ft. \n \nThe existing perceived threat is that the Intruder will scale the wall to gain access to the Airport \nfacility; therefore specific Electronic Systems need to be designed to provide a stable Perimeter \nIntruder Detection System with a low false alarm rate. As per circular 2/2007, certain \ntechnologies were specified for PIDS. However with advancement in technological innovation, \nthere arises a need to make the PIDS specification more relevant with changing times and \nincreased threat perception.  \n \nThe existing Perimeter Walls present some challenges as follows: \n \na. Built Up areas  \nb. Direct Access to the perimeter by General Public   \nc. Condition and application of the Physical Barrier protection  \nd. Environmental conditions  \ne. Broken perimeter wall and with gaps at places \nf. Other unforeseen challenges  \n \nTo address the security requirement taking into consideration the existing parameters, it is \nproposed that Perimeter Intruder Detection System solution should contain the following: \n(Changes have been incorporated as per Discussions held during subcommittee of TSC \nmeeting held on 27/08/2015) \n \na. A full-fledged Mandatory Primary Detection System from the list of approved \ntechnologies as per requirement/ site condition.  \nb. The Perimeter Intruder Detection System must be interfaced with a comprehensive \nCCTV surveillance system (each Perimeter Detection Zone will have a dedicated CCTV \ncamera associated with it).  \nc.
