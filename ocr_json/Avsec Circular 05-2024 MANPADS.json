Introduction:\n\n2.1. Attacks on aircraft engaged in civil air transport by surface-to-air missiles\n(short-range), or man-portable air defence systems (MANPADS), have been rare\nbut are not unknown. Successful defence against such an attack is challenging\nbut not impossible and depends on close cooperation and coordination among\nground forces, law enforcement, intelligence agencies, operators, flight crews and\nair traffic services.\n\n3. Objective:\n3.1. To outline and implement comprehensive security measures aimed to\nmitigate the risks posed by Man-portable Air Defence Systems (MANPADS) and\n\nother weapons posing a similar threat to aircraft, vulnerable area at or near an\naerodrome.\n\n4. Scope:\n4.1. These instructions are applicable to all airport operators, aircraft operators,\n\nstate police, national intelligence agencies, state administration and relevant\nsecurity agencies responsible for the protection of aircraft and airport facilities.\n\naaZ\n",

The National Intelligence Agencies, shall carry out threat assessment of the\nAircraft, Aerodrome and connected infrastructure from MANPADS based on the\nintelligence reports, historical data, threat to flights operating to specific countries\nand topography. Intelligence Agencies shall all also identify high-risk areas for\nattack.\n\n5.2. Vulnerability Assessment:\n5.2.1. A Committee comprising of Airport Operator, Intelligence Agencies, State\n\nPolice, Sate Administration, ASG, Air Traffic Service Provider and Regional\nDirector, BCAS shall carry out vulnerability assessment.\n\n5.2.2. Presence of High rise buildings, adjacent terrain, height of perimeter,\nfunnel area and other demographical factors may be considered while carrying out\nvulnerability assessment.\n\n5.2.3. The committee shall evaluate the effectiveness of existing mitigation\nmeasures also while assessing vulnerability.\n\n5.3. Risk Management:\n\n5.3.1. Based on the threat assessment and subsequent assessment of\nconsequences and vulnerabilities, the committee shall assess the residual risk\nassociated with MANPADS. Depending upon the residual risk, suggest and\nimplement the additional mitigation measures with view to reduce the residual\nrisk.\n\n5.3.2. Develop and implement a risk management plan that addresses identified\nvulnerabilities and threats prioritising actions based on the level of risk and\npotential impact on operations.\n\n5.3.3. The National Risk Context Statement and Guidelines on Threat and Risk\nassessment methodology shall be followed as a guidance material.\n\n5.3.4. ICAO Doc 10084 addresses the broader risks posed by long-range surface-\nto-air missiles (SAMs) in conflict zones, while the MANPADS Toolkit specifically\ntargets the high-risk scenarios at lower altitudes associated with MANPADS. Same\nmay also be referred as guidance tool.\n\nQo\n",
