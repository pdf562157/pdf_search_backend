No part of this document may be disclosed to a person without a \u201cneed to know\u201d as defined in NCASP. \ni \n \nPREFACE \nThe safety, regularity and efficiency of civil aviation and its facilities is increasingly \nthreatened by a variety of criminal acts.  There is thus a need to take every possible \nmeasure to ensure the protection and safeguarding of passengers, flight crew, ground \npersonnel, the general public and civil aviation facilities against acts of unlawful \ninterference perpetrated on the ground and in-flight.  These measures should be \ncustomized and based on a risk assessment, to counter different levels of threat. \n \nThe International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), an agency of the United Nations, \nseeks to promote appropriate levels of aviation security throughout the global \ncommunity. ICAO promulgates Standards and Recommended Practices (SARPs) in \nrespect of civil aviation security through Annex 17 of the Chicago Convention, 1944 \nwhich is applicable from 21st February 2024. Requirements of 12th edition of Annex 17 \nis reflected in this document. \nIn addition, the United Nations Security Council met in September 2016 and adopted \nresolution 2309 (UNSCR 2309 (2016), which affirmed States\u2019 responsibility to ensure \nthe safety of air services operating within their territory and called on all States to \nensure that international security standards were reviewed, updated, adapted and put \nin place based on current risks. It also urged all States to ensure cooperation among \ntheir domestic departments, agencies and other entities. \nIndia is a signatory to the Chicago Convention and Annex-17 to the convention \ncontains a series of SARPs with which India is expected to comply. Specifically, Annex-\n17 Standard 3.4.1 places the obligation on the appropriate authority of the contracting \nstate with respect to the training programmes and certification within the aviation \nsecurity oversight system to: \n\u201c\u2026ensure the development and implementation of a National Training Policy for all \npersonnel involved with or responsible for the implementation of various aspects of the \nNational Civil Aviation Security Programme. This training policy shall be designed to \nensure the effectiveness of the National Civil Aviation Security Programme.\u201d \n \nThis, the Sixth Edition of the National Civil Aviation Security Training Programme \n(NCASTP) is developed/revised by the DG, BCAS in 2024, in accordance with the \ncurrent Twelfth Edition of Annex 17 dated 18th July 2022, Amendment 18, which is \napplicable from 18th  November 2022, along with the guidance detailed in ICAO \nDocument 8973, \u201cAviation Security Manual\u201d (Thirteenth Edition of 2022), and provides \na degree of harmonization with good practices identified elsewhere in the global \ncommunity. \nThe NCASTP of Republic of India has been developed to support implementation of civil \naviation security requirements required by the NCASP and/or aviation security \nlegislation.  It outlines the policies and procedures for the selection, recruitment, \ntraining, and certification of personnel in the aviation industry with security \nresponsibilities, and personnel with non-security responsibilities. All agencies involved \nin the provision of civil aviation security training are to implement, adhere to or be \nguided by, as appropriate, the provisions detailed in the Approved Programme.",

Objective: -  \n  \n1.1.1 The objective of the National Civil Aviation Security Training Programme \n(NCASTP) of India is to provide a framework for recruitment and training in aviation \nsecurity. The Programme outlines the requirements to: \n \n(a)  identify roles and responsibilities for the delivery of training activities within the \ncivil aviation system; \n(b)  define the various methods that may be used in delivering training; \n(c)  outline minimum standards of training for specific aviation security functions; \n(d)  establish standards for the selection, training and certification of aviation \nsecurity personnel; \n(e) promote compliance with the National Civil Aviation Security Program (NCASP); \n(f)  comply with international obligations. \n \n1.1.2 The delivery of appropriate (and regular) training is essential in achieving \naviation security outcomes and safeguarding against acts of unlawful interference. \nThe NCASTP seeks to produce suitably trained personnel, who can apply a \nstandardised level of preventive security for the safe operation of flights under \nnormal operating conditions; and who are capable of rapidly expanding such \nsecurity to meet any increased threat. \n \n1.1.3 This Programme provides guidance for the respective AVSEC training-related \nresponsibilities of all entities involved in or overseeing security measures described \nin the NCASP of the Republic of India. In addition to establishing the national \nrequirements, the format is designed to assist with the development of Civil \nAviation Security Training Programmes (CASTP) by stakeholders. \n \n1.1.4 This Programme defines the different types of activities and training that all \nentities involved in or associated with civil aviation security are required to provide \nto their staff and/or other stakeholders on need-to-know basis.  This Programme \nspecifies the criteria for training of all security staff/non-security staff, including \nthe contents of the applicable modules, before they assume their duties.  \n  \n1.2. Scope \n  \n1.2.1 The provisions of this Programme shall apply to all entities/stakeholders \ninvolved in or responsible for all aspects of the NCASP implementation. \nImplementation of this Programme does not override any regulation or act \npertaining to the security and safety of civil aviation in India. \n \n1.2.2 The NCASTP also outlines the process associated with the NCASTP\u2019s own \nadministration and the process for submission of organizational training \nprogrammes to the DG, BCAS.",
