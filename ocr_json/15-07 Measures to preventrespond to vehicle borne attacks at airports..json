The possibility of similar attack.on Indian Airports cannot be\nLi tuled out. The Counter Terrorist Contingency Plans (CTCP), drafted for\nOy ; various airports, address this scenario. However, the following\n\u2018OF steps/measures are directed to beef up the security arrangements In order to\nis prevent and effectively respond to such an attempted forcible\nOF intrusion/explosion by a vehicle:\n\nol Wherever in existence, nakas on the approach roads to the terminals :\nr manned by the ASG should be activated In order to screen and Identify\noO I suspicious vehicles. Following measures should be taken;\n\n> The Nakas should have adequate/prominent signages requesting\n\nall incoming vehicles to stop for security checking. Barricades\nmay be erected to compel approaching vehicles to slow down for\nthe same. A drill should be evolved by the ASG staff for this\npurpose.\n\n> Personnel deployed at such Nakas should be briefed about the\n\nVE things which should arouse their suspicion while screening\no vehicles at the Nakas.\nye > Separate bays should be earmarked for thorough checking of\nsuspect vehicles without disturbing the normal flow of traffic..\n~ > Effective means should be in place to immobilize vehicles\nure\n\nidentified as potential threats (which do not stop or subject\nco themselves to security checks at nakas) by installing motorized\n\n",

Effective measures to stop any vehicle from Intruding\ninto this buffer zone with the intention of ramming into the\n\u00a9 terminal bullding should be taken by Installation of bollards (on\nray ramps), reinforced steel railings or concrete road dividers of\nadequate height.\n0 > The armed elements deployed on the cityside of the terminal\ncx building and access control points/gates, in addition to the.

In-addition to sturdy barrlers capable of high\nspeed motorized operation, a second line of defence (retractable\nbollards/tyre-killers/hi-speed ramps etc) should be in. place to\n\nimmobilize a speeding suspect vehicle, which refuse to stop for\nchecking by on duty ASG staff at the gate.\n\n5. These issues should be taken up with the airport operators and\nfeedback sent to Airport Sector HQ within one month for further follow\nup. These issues should also be raised and got recorded in the Airport\nSecurity Committee meetings.\n\n6.
