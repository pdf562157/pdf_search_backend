CISF has gained confidence of the Government\nafter the-IC-814 mishap occurred on 24\u201d December\u20191999. Resulting which, the\nnumber of airports under CISF security cover have gradually grawn upta 59-as.on\ndate and will also increase in the years to come, CiSF is responsible for anti-\nhijacking dutles, access control and pre-embarkation checking. On these\nobligations, though CISF Airport Sector has proved its efficacy and multiplied the\nname and fame for our organization, a group of irresponsible: personnel have\nfailed to resist themselves exhibiting high-headed approach in their reaction to\npetty cases which result in unnecessary conflict and tarnished image. of this\nForce. Recently, an incident of use af some force against tax! drivers, by CISF\npersonnel from-one. of the ASGs, has come to the notice at this HQ. This shows\nlack of professionalism and tactfulness in handling of the situations. Law and\norder falls under the jurisdiction of the local police and CISF personnel could have\nhanded thern over to the locai police to deal with the issue.\n\noll\n\nSuch incidents have not only invited unwarranted unpleasantness but also\ndiverted the facus of the Force from its prime duty. This also indicates a lack of\nclose supervision by the supervisory officers over the aggressive behavior of CISE\nstaff while dealing with public/civilian at airports,\n\n2, Time and agein, it has been instructed that law and order\nsituation/problem at land side is the sole responsibility of local police except at\nMumbai and Seihi Airport where CISF strength has been sanctioned and\naugmented for manning land side. in this regard, elaborate directions:have been\n\n~ given vide APS HQ Circular No.31/2007, emphasizing on the need to imbibe the\nrequisite skills amongst the personnel in dealing with passengers/staff at\nparticular duty posts which require public interface.
