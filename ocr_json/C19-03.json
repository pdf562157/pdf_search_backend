  "1": "CIRCULAR NO . 19 /  2003 \n \n \nAs per the laid down procedure hand baggages are manually checked by \nsecurity staff  when something suspicious is noticed in it  by   X-ray screeners.  \nBesides,  20 to 30% of hand baggage are checked physically at random.  It has \nbeen observed that the  physical checking of  hand baggage of  passengers   is \nnot  done properly and as a result a number of  objectionable items are not \ndetected and removed from hand baggages. Such instances have been brought \nto the notice of this Bureau when  the banned items like live or used cartridges, \nsmall knives could  be carried  by passengers in their hand baggage even after \npre-embarkation security checks.  \n \n  \nIn  view of the   above   it  is emphasized that  security staff responsible for \npre-embarkation security checks are  suitably  briefed  to ensure that any  hand  \nbaggage categorized   as suspicious  during X-ray examination,   shall   be \nphysically checked. \n \n \n \n(R.K. Singh) \nAddl. Commissioner of  Security (CA) \n \n \n \nRef : No. CAS-7(1) 2003-Div-1  dated 19 June 2003"
