This leads to un-intended\npanic/anxiety amongst the travelling public and at the same time, it does\nnot serve any public interest. It also encourages mischief-mongers to\nindulge in pranks for the sake of cheap fun/sadistic pleasure. As far as,\ninteraction with the press/media is concerned, there are well known\nrules/norms governing the same. A very strict view has been taken about\nthis kind of indiscretion on the part of the CISF personnel.\n\nDisG/Airport, CASOs and all gazetted officers of the units should\nensure that such information is passed on to the CISF personnel only\nduring briefing to the extent necessary from operational point of view and\n\u2018on a need to know basis. There should be no unauthorized contact with\nthe press/media in these matters. All concerned to ensure immediate\ncompliance.\n\nVeeairys\n(Ms. Bail\" \"*\nInspector General/AS\n\nDistribution:\n\nDIG/Airport(South Zone ), CISF, Chennai\n\nDIG Airport ( East & North East Zone), CISF Kolkatta\nDiG/Airport(West Zone) CISF, Mumbai\n\nADIG/AP (NZ), CISF New Delhi\n\nAll CASOs CISF ASGs,\n\nAIG/AS\n\nPAWNS\n"
