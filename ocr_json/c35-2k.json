  "1": "CIRCULAR 35 / 2000 \n \n \nSUB: PHYSICAL  CHECKING LADY PASSENGERS \n \n \nIt has been brought to the notice of this Bureau that at certain airports physical \nchecking of hand baggage of lady passengers whenever considered necessary by APS staff is \nnot done by a female security officer.  Rather a male security officer performs this task.  In \nthe interest of courtesy it is imperative that physical checking offhand baggage of female \npassenger should be undertaken by lady security officer only.  All concerned may be suitably \nbriefed to ensure this aspect. \n \n (R.K.Singh) \nADDL.COMMISSIONER OF SECURITY (CA) \n \nNO.CAS-5(11)/98-DIV-I \nDated : 20.10.2000"
