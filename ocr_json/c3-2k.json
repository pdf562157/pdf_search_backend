  "1": "CIRCULAR 3/2000 \n \nSUB : GUARDING OF VITAL INSTALLATIONS AT AIRPORT \n \n1. \nIt has been brought to our notice that the Terminal Building / operational Areas of \ndomestic sector at the Civil Airports in India are not guarded by armed guards of the \nconcerned state / U T Police.  Under the current surcharged atmosphere in the country and \nthreat to aviation target from terrorist outfits in the country, it is a matter of paramount \nimportance that airports should not be left unguarded.  Sabotage activities by miscreants / \nterrorists in the airports to cause unlawful interference with civil aviation operations cannot \nbe ruled out.  It has, therefore, been decided that the terminal buildings and vital installations \nlike ATC; armed guards should guard VOR etc. \n \n2. \nIt is requested that necessary directions to the concerned SSPs may please be issued to \ndeploy armed guards for protection of the airports in your jurisdiction. \n \n(VEERANNA AIVALLI) \nCOMMISSIONER OF SECURITY (CA) \n \nNO.CAS-3(1)/2000-DIV-I \nDated : 14.01.2000"
