It is also\nnecessary to regularly train and sensitise the ASG personnel on various valid\ndocuments for entry to airports and areas inside the airport. Broadly, the following\naspects must be regularly briefed to the personnel:-\n(i).\nTypes of documents whlch are authorised for entry of a person.\nThings to be seen and verified for confirming legitimacy of entry documents.\nTechniques of checking the documents without consuming much time (which\nirritates the pax, staff) but slmultaneously without compromising with\nsecurity requirements.\n(ii).\n(iiD.",
