As a result, some \nuntoward incidents, which could have been prevented, have happened in the recent past. \nIn one incident at Indore airport, large number of protesters managed to enter \nunauthorisedly even into restricted areas of the airport. \n \nUnlawful gathering in front of the Terminal building and/ or unauthorized entry \ninto security controlled and security restricted areas of the airport may lead to breach in \nsecurity and thereby an act of unlawful interference with civil aviation operations at the \nairport. So, it is imperative to take all possible steps to prevent any such incident. \n \nIn view of the above, all Airport Directors and Chief Airport Security Officers \nmust review and strengthen security arrangement at the airport, and also liaise well in \nadvance with local police/ administration authorities for making proper law and order \narrangement during the bandh/ protest march etc. \n \n \n(R.C.
