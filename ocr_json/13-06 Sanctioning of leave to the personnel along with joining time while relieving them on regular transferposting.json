This results in a lot of administrative inconvenience since\nthese personnel do not report to their new units in time and the latter, in turn,\nare unable to relieve the dues out personnel or face shortage of manpower for\nlack of timely (dues in) replacements.\n\nIn view of the above, it is hereby directed that henceforth, no leave of any\nkind should be granted to personnel being posted out by the respective\nunit commanders with joining time. All personnel are expected to fulfill their\npersonal obligations during the joining time due to them. Further leave, if\ndesired, should be applied for at their new unit(s) after they report therein. In\nexceptional cases of genuine and extreme emergency, the unit commanders\nshould consult/refer the matter to this Headquarters with their specific\nrecommendation in each case. In any case, leave should not be granted till a\ndecision is conveyed from this end. This is effective immediately.\n\nPlease acknowledge receipt and ensure strict compliance.\n\nTe \u00a9 0\n(MS.
