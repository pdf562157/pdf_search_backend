The relevant regulations concern the field of facilitation, not security, and are contained \nin Annex 9 \u2014 Facilitation.  Each State should ensure that Annex 9 SARPs are implemented by aircraft \noperators operating from its territory. \n \n5.1.2 \nAttention, however, should be drawn to certain provisions of Annex 17 since the special \ncategories of passengers cited above must be viewed as potentially disruptive. More specifically, persons \nin lawful custody are not addressed in Annex 9 provisions. \n \n \n5.2 \nSPECIFIC TERMS AND DEFINITIONS \n \n5.2.1 \nIn addition to the definitions presented in Chapter 1, the following specific terms are used \nwhen referring to the special categories of passengers cited above. \n \na)   DEPO \u2013 industry-approved code for a deportee; \n \nb)   DEPA  \u2013  industry-approved  code  for  a  deportee  accompanied  by  an  authorized \nescort; \n \nc)   DEPU \u2013 industry-approved  code for a deportee not accompanied by an authorized \nescort; \n \nd)   deporting  State  \u2013  the  State  that  has  arranged  for  a  deportee\u2019s  removal  from  its \nterritory; \n \ne)   escort  \u2013  a  person  authorized  by  the  deporting  State  who  has  been  trained  to \naccompany deportees on removal flights; \n \nf) \nINAD \u2013 an inadmissible passenger (a passenger refused admission to a State by its \nauthorities  or  refused  onward  carriage  by  a  State  authority  at  a  transfer  point \nbecause he or she lacks the required visa, has an expired passport, etc.); and \n \ng)   persons in lawful custody \u2013 persons either under arrest or convicted by courts of law \nwho must be transported to another State for legal reasons. \n \nNote. \u2014 For the transport of persons in lawful custody, an escort should be provided by the competent \nauthorities. \n \n \n5.3 \nRESPONSIBILITIES \n \n5.3.1 \nEach State should develop regulatory requirements for the carriage of passengers who \nare obliged to travel because they have been the subject of judicial or administrative proceedings, and \nshould  also  develop,  in  cooperation  with  aircraft  operators,  procedures  for  the  carriage  of  the  special \ncategories of passengers cited above. \n \n5.3.2 \nRequirements  concerning  such  passengers  should  be  reflected  in  the  NCASP  and \nNCASTP.

All  parties  involved,  such  as  law  enforcement  authorities  and  aircraft  and  airport \noperators, should cooperate fully with one another in applying the relevant provisions. \n \n \nRisk assessment \n \n5.3.5 \nRisk   assessments   should   be   carried   out   by   authorities   for   passengers   who   are \nearmarked for removal from a State, and the results should be communicated to the aircraft operator and \nthe pilot-in-command. Risk assessments should take into account passengers\u2019 history, past and current \nbehaviour, any media or activist activity and any other relevant aspects that may indicate a security risk. \n \n5.3.6 \nBased on the results of risk assessments, authorities should indicate whether an escort is \nnecessary.

  "4": "Chapter 5. \nPotentially Disruptive Passengers \n5-115 \n \n \na)   inadmissible  persons.  The  relevant  authorities  should  notify  the  aircraft  operator \n(usually  the  inbound  carrier)  without  delay,  and  normally  on  the  same  day  as  the \npassenger\u2019s arrival, of the need to transport an inadmissible person. The deadline for \nnotifying the aircraft operator of a passenger\u2019s inadmissibility (including the reason for \nsuch  refusal)  is  the  check-in  cut-off  time  for  the  intended  outbound  flight.  The \npilot-in-command  should  be  made  aware  of  the  need  to  transport  an  inadmissible \nperson during pre-flight preparations and prior to passenger boarding; \n \nb)   deportees.  The  relevant  authorities  should  give  sufficient  notice  to  the  aircraft \noperator  any time  a  deportee  is  to  travel by air,  and  normally should  provide  such \nnotification  at  least  24  hours  before  the  intended  departure,  but  certainly  not  less \nthan  three  hours  in  advance.  The  pilot-in-command  should  be  informed  of  the \ndeportation, including the reason for expelling the individual and for assigning (or not \nassigning) an escort, during pre-flight preparations; and \n \nc)   persons in custody. The relevant authorities should inform the aircraft operator of the \nintention to travel with a person in custody at least 24 hours prior to departure. The \nnotification (required in writing) should indicate whether the passenger is considered \ndangerous,  and  should  include  any  other  pertinent  information  that  may  help  the \noperator  assess  the  risk  to  flight  security.  Persons  in  custody  should  always  be \nescorted by one or more law enforcement officers whose identities and nationalities \nshould be disclosed to the aircraft operator. The pilot-in-command should be made \naware of the situation during pre-flight preparations. \n \n \n5.4 \nGENERAL PROCEDURES \nDeportees and inadmissible persons \n5.4.1 \nIn the case of deportees that are to be transported by air, the responsibility for effecting \nrepatriation   lies   with   law   enforcement   authorities.   With   respect   to   an   inadmissible   person,   the \nresponsibility for repatriation falls to the inbound operator, since Annex 9 provisions require that aircraft \noperators  take  appropriate  measures  to  ensure  that  travel  documents  are  in  order  at  the  embarkation \npoint. If an aircraft operator is required to transport an inadmissible person, the passenger should be in \npossession of travel documents or, if these documents were seized, of a covering letter for presentation \nto the appropriate authority. \n \n5.4.2 \nIn  addition  to  notifying  the  aircraft  operator  of  the  intention  to  transport  a  deportee  or \ninadmissible  person,  appropriate  authorities  should  notify public  authorities  in  the  State  of  repatriation, \nand in any State where the passenger will be in transit. \n \n5.4.3 \nOne or more escorts should accompany a deportee if an assessment indicates that the \npassenger may offer resistance and could pose a security risk during flight. \n \n5.4.4 \nIn-flight  security  is  usually  provided  by  government-employed  officers.  However,  if \npreferred, aircraft operators may deploy their own security personnel instead. Escorting officers should be \nspecially  trained  and  briefed  to  carry  out  their  duties  (guidance  on  security  measures  for  passengers \naccompanied by escorts and provisions for armed escorts may be found in Section 5.5 and Chapter 6, \nrespectively). \n \n \nPersons in custody \n \n5.4.5 \nResponsibility for a person in lawful custody who must be transported by air lies with the \nappropriate authorities, who should notify the aircraft operator of the travel intentions in advance and may \nproceed only with the aircraft operator\u2019s agreement to carry the potentially disruptive passenger.",
  "5": "Security Manual \n5-116 \nVolume IV \n \n \n5.4.6 \nTo  ensure  flight  security,  aircraft  operators  may  transport  persons  in  custody  under \ncertain conditions, i.e. if the person in custody is: \n \na)   not  considered  dangerous,  the  passenger  should  be  accompanied  by  at  least  one \nlaw enforcement officer (with the agreement of the aircraft operator); and \n \nb)   deemed   dangerous,   two   or   more   law   enforcement   officers   should   escort   the \npassenger  (notwithstanding  the  presence  of  escorts,  not  more  than  one  such \npassenger should be allowed on any flight). \n \n \n5.5 \nSECURITY MEASURES \n \n5.5.1 \nMany  inadmissible  persons,  deportees  and  persons  in  custody  travel  voluntarily  and \npeacefully, but on occasion such persons may present a security risk. The number of escorts required for \neach situation, if any, is determined jointly by the relevant authorities and the aircraft operator. \n \n5.5.2 \nBefore boarding a potentially disruptive passenger, the authorities should verify with their \ncounterparts at transit points and the final destination that the travel intentions are acceptable to them. \n \n5.5.3 \nCertain preventive measures should be in effect before and during a flight with potentially \ndisruptive passengers on board, as follows: \n \na)   the number of inadmissible passengers, deportees or persons in custody should be \nlimited  according  to  the  aircraft  size,  reason  for  removal  of  the  individual  from  the \nState and risk assessment; \n \nb)   a sufficient number of escorts should be deployed, based on the nature and number \nof potentially disruptive passengers and a risk assessment; \n \nc)   the flight itinerary should be kept classified and should not be disclosed to the public; \n \nd)   additional security searches should be conducted on passengers and cabin baggage; \n \ne)   inadmissible  persons,  deportees  or  persons  in  custody should  be  boarded  prior  to \nother  passengers,  and  the  pilot-in-command  should  be  informed  of  the  seating \nlocation of such passengers and their escorts; \n \nf) \nseats should be assigned as far as possible to the rear of the cabin, but not adjacent \nto a door or emergency exit, and should be in a row of two or more seats with at least \none escort sitting between the potentially disruptive passenger and the aisle (to the \nextent practicable, the escorted passenger should not be seated next to a minor); \n \ng)   alcoholic  beverages  should  not  be  served  to  escorts  and  the  passengers  they \naccompany; \n \nh)   food  and  non-alcoholic  beverages  may  be  served  at  the  discretion  of  escorts,  but \nshould not be accompanied by metal utensils or a knife; and \n \ni) \ndepending on the risk assessment, restraining devices should be available for use by the \nescort. \n \nNote. \u2014 The use of restraining devices by an escort should be limited to actual need and should conform \nto the laws of the State and the applicable aircraft operator\u2019s policy.",
