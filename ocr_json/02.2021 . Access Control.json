Block, Ground Floor\nMahipalpur, New Delhi-37\nDated: 6(luty'ZOZt\nCircular No. AS - 0L /2021\nSub: Access Control system\nA robust access control system forms a formidable paft of any security set-up. As\naviation security is a layered defence system, the access control plays a vital role in\ncuftailing the unauthorized access. However, a number of instances of lapse in access\ncontrol duties at the airpofts have come to the notice of APS HQ. Recently, an on-duty\nCISF personnel who was deployed at the departure gate for regulating access control,\nfailed to match the face of the bearer with the photo in the ID proof produced. This led to\nan unauthorized entry into the Terminal Building. However, the intruder was intercepted\nby ASG personnel, while he was trying to exit the Terminal Building. The issue was\nhighlighted as a breach in access control duties by sister security / intelligence agencies.\n2. It is reiterated that access control system is an essential and integral part of Civil\nAviation Security duties at airpofts and the responsibility for enforcement of this system\nlies with the ASG. The more effective and strong the access control system will be, lesser\nwill be the stress on the subsequent layers of security. Hence, it is necessary to emphasise\nthe effectiveness of our access control system and to continuously strive to plug the\nloopholes, if any. Therefore, a very tactful and matured approach is required to be\nadopted by CISF staff in order to improve their standard at access control points. The\nfollowing instructions are being issued in this regard:-\n(i). To regularly train and sensitise the ASG personnel on various types of valid\ndocuments for entry into the Terminal Building and areas inside the airpoft,\nemphasizing on the minute details of the documents including photo, validity date,\nareas/ etc. as applicable.\n(ii). To undertake an exercise to identify the possible details/features/area, where\ngenerally the duty personnel make mistakes.\n(iii). To identify the individual weakness of the concerned duty personnel after thorough\nground work at micro level so that each personnel detailed for access control duties\nare fully competent in identifying all the details in the travel documents,\nAEPsfl-AEPs, Tokens, etc.\n(iv). To make optimum use of CRPs (Core Resource Persons) so as to sensitize the ASG\npersonnel regarding existing circulars / orders, issued by BCAS, APS HQ and FHQ.\n\"ql .rs (ft, qrw t qs-ft\"",

It is important to mention that the deployment of personnel should be\ncommensurate to the requirement of every duty post matching with the attributes of the\nindividuals i.e. Right person for Right job. Accordingly, suitable personnel should be\ndeployed at the access control points. The personnel should emphasise on the following\naspects while checking the documents at the access control points:-\nsl.\nNo.\nDocuments\nDetails to be checked\na)\nTicket/E-ticket\nDate & time.\nName of the passenger.\nOrigin & destination.\nFlight Number.\nSector (Domestic or International).\nNo. of passenqers.\nb)\nID Cards\n.
