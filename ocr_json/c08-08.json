Agents may be small \ncompanies that simply direct consignment of cargo to larger agents or big \ncompanies that purchase space on aircraft operated by a number of airlines and \nconsolidate consignments from a wide range of sources to fill that capacity.  \nAgents and airlines conduct considerable volume of their business under \ncontract.  However, it is possible for small companies or individuals operating \nCargo or Courier services to dispatch small single consignment by air either \nthrough agents or directly through airlines. \n \nCargo agents and airlines prescribe the way in which the Cargo they \nhandle is packed.  They also obtain declaration of its contents from the \nconsigners for incorporating it in the airway bill.  It helps in obtaining Customs \nclearance and also provides evidence to the effect that the consignment does not \ncontain any incendiary or explosive device, which may hazard the aircraft. \n \nGenerally Cargo is handled through dedicated Cargo facility at the airport. \nIt may be transported on a passenger aircraft, by an all Cargo aircraft or a Combi \naircraft.",
  "2": "Circulars for website(Cicular) \nSecurity concerns: \n \nThreat to civil aviation, to a large extent, depends on existence of people \nwith the motivation and means to attack aviation.  It will vary from place to place \nand it is the responsibility of each State to assess the threat within its jurisdiction \nand require commensurate security measures.  Normally a threat of sabotage \nattack against an aircraft is unlikely to apply to all aircraft at all location and all \nthe times.  It usually reaches a combination of airlines and locations.  Airports \nwhich are used by national flag carriers are more vulnerable because the \nterrorists target them as a means of attacking a specific country.  Thus Cargo, \nExpress Cargo, Mail and Courier operations undertaken by a national flag carrier \nat major international airports are more likely to attract threat than those by other \nairlines at domestic airports. \nThe risk on aircraft by means of Cargo, Express Cargo, Mail or courier \noperations, particularly if a terrorist group decides to attack civil aviation in an \nindiscriminate way is relatively high because: \n \n(a) Consignments of Cargo, Express Cargo, Mail and Courier bags are \noriginated by a wide range of companies and individuals; \n(b) Consignments may pass through a number of Agents before they \ncome under direct control of the airlines which will ultimately convey \nthem.  Thus their security depends upon each agent maintaining \nadequate standards of security controls.  \n(c) The operations afford an opportunity to attack without exposing     \nthe attacker to an immediate risk of arrest. \n(d) Access to Cargo loading zone may afford access to airside areas \nand aircraft. \n \nThreat from incendiary/explosive devices \n \nCargo, Express Cargo, Mail and Courier operations afford means of \nintroducing an explosive device on board an aircraft in order to destroy it.  Such \ndevices may be detonated either by: \n \n(a) \na barometric trigger which will activate at a pre-determined altitude; \nor \n(b) \nA timing mechanism mechanical or electronic which can be \nprogrammed to activate after an extended period of time which may \nbe a few hours, days or even months or \n(c) \nA combination of both. \n \nExplosive devices activated by a barometric trigger are more suitable for \nattack on flights of short duration when it is difficult to identify precisely when an \naircraft is likely to be in the air.  Timing devices afford terrorists the means of \nattacking long haul flights since the problem of selecting a time when the aircraft \nwill be in air is less critical.",
  "3": "Circulars for website(Cicular) \nSecurity may be undermined by: \n \na) \nan explosive device planted into a consignment by the consigner or \nin the case of a company by one of their employees \n \n \n                                     or \nb) \nan explosive device being introduced into a consignment when it is \nin the custody of agents or airlines. \n \nThreat from a weaponised Cargo aircraft. \n \nIncidents of 9/11 in U.S. have demonstrated that an aircraft can be \nweaponised by the terrorists and thereby used to cause mass destruction of life \nand properly.  In order to prevent recurrence of such incident in future it is \nimperative to strengthen security measures both on the ground and in the air.  \nEffective anti-hijacking measures have to be in place at all airports to prevent the \nterrorists from getting access to the aircraft.  Airport security agencies need to \nco-ordinate with the local police agencies to obtain timely information about the \ndesigns and activities of the terrorist groups which may pose threat to civil \naviation.  As regards on-board security measures, the cockpit doors must be \nstrengthened and kept closed during the flight. \n \nAIR CARGO SECURITY MEASURES \n \nThere will be four categories of security measures for cargo/express cargo. \n \n1. \nAccount Customer Security Measures \u2013 for freighter class cargo \n \nFor Cargo which will be conveyed by an all cargo aircraft only and not by \npassenger or Combi aircraft, an account customer may choose to undertake \nprescribed  security measures before the consignment of such freighter class \ncargo is delivered to a regulated agent or an aircraft operator for transportation \nas a freighter class known cargo.  In the absence of such prescribed security \ncontrols by the account customer, the cargo will be handled as unknown cargo \nby the regulated agent/aircraft operator. \n \n2. \nKnown-consigner security measures \n \nSecurity measures which a Known-consigner may choose to implement in \nrespect of a consignment of cargo prior to that cargo being delivered to a \nregulated agent or an aircraft operator for conveying as known cargo. In case the \nKnown-consigner does not implement the prescribed security measures in \nrespect of such consignment, it will be treated as unknown cargo by the \nRegulated agent/aircraft operator. \n \n3. \nSecurity measures by the Regulated Air cargo Agent:",

For this, the companies will retain the right to open Express Cargo \npackages at their respective premises.  After physical check of the contents, the \npackages will be repacked in the company\u2019s envelopes.  \n \nExpress cargo companies will also not inform the consigners as to which \nairline will carry a particular item of Express cargo.  If a consigner requires to \nknow particulars of the airline which will carry his items, it will be recorded and \nthe record held for one month.  It will be treated as suspicious consignment and \nsecurity processed with full caution. \n \n \nExpress Cargo will be subjected to either of the following security measures \nbefore it is placed on board an aircraft. \n \n(a) \nExpress Cargo, which has been subjected to prescribed Account customers \nsecurity measures by an Account Customer will be treated as Freighter class \nKnown Cargo and handled accordingly as per the laid down security procedure \nby the Regulated Air Cargo Agent or the aircraft operator. \n \n(b) \nExpress Cargo which has been subjected to prescribed Known consigner \nsecurity measures by a Known consigner will be treated as Known cargo and \nhandled accordingly as per the laid down security procedure by the Regulated Air \nCargo agent or the aircraft operator. \n \n(c) \nExpress Cargo, which has been subjected to prescribed Known Cargo or \nunknown cargo security measures, as the case may be, by the Regulated air \nCargo agent will be treated as Known Cargo by the aircraft operator and handled \naccordingly as per the laid down security norms.   \n \n(d) \nUnknown Express cargo received directly by an aircraft operator will be secured \nfirst as Known Cargo, as per the prescribed security procedure and thereafter \nhandled as Known Cargo before finally being placed on board the aircraft. \n \n \nSECURITY MEASURES FOR COURIER BAGS \n \n \n \nCourier traffic is essentially Express cargo transported by or on behalf of \nthe Courier companies.  The consignments accompanied by a courier are \ntransported as hold baggage.  The reason why Courier accompanies the \nconsignment is to facilitate their passage through controls and to ensure that \nthese are not delayed.
