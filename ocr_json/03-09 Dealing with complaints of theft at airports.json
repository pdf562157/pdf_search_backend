Dethi\n\nNo.0-4201 1/APC/OPS(2)/Circular/AS/09 -22 5S\" 31\u00b0 March 2009\nIRCU! = 03/2009\n\nSub: Dealing with complaints of theft at Airports:\n\nTheft of passenger baggage at airports is a cause of perpetual concern.\nThough reported thefts are investigated by the local police, the occurrence of\n\u2018such incidents adversely reflect on the overall ambience of security and order at\nairports for which CISF is responsible.\n\n2. Within an airport, certain areas are particularly vulnerable to theft/pilferage\ndue to their busy and chaotic environment. Miscreants tend to target such places.\nAt the same time, there is tendency among the victims not to lodge a complaint,\ndue to which the culprits often go scot-free, even if caught.\n\n3. The ASGs, when made aware of such complaints of theft/pilferage and\nother illegal activities must take concrete proactive steps in dealing with such\ncomplaints/incidents to uphold the faith of the general public.\n\n4. Despite electronic and manual surveillance being in place at most airports\nand available legal remedy for such incidents, they continue unabated particularly\nat Metro airports. Therefore, to prevent theft/pilferage and to bring the culprits to\nbook, a more proactive procedure needs to be established. The following\nguidelines are hereby being issued in this regard:\n\n(i) Extensive monitoring through CCTV with extra emphasis on the theft\nprone areas should be done by the ASGs where the CCTV system is in\nplace. Where not available, intensive surveillance should be ensured by\nCIW staff of the unit.\n\n(ii) It shall be ensured that CCTV cameras are appropriately\nlocated/focussed to enable proper surveillance of the theft prone areas\non the cityside and inside airport terminals, including SHAs. CASOs\nshould take personal interest in getting the cameras relocated, if need\nbe, to facilitate effective CCTV monitoring.\n\n(iii) Concerted efforts should be made to get the entire area under CCTV\ncoverage. Special emphasis should be given to extend coverage to theft\nprone areas.\n\nCont.. P/2\n",
