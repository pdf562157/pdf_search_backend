  "7": "FOREWORD \n(v) \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Aviation Security Manual was developed to assist States in promoting safety and security in civil aviation. The \nobjective of this manual is to assist States in the prevention of and, whenever necessary, response to, acts of unlawful \ninterference, through the development of the following elements: \n \na) \nlegal framework and security oversight; \n \nb) \nairport design, infrastructure and equipment; \n \nc) \nrecruitment, selection, training and certification; and \n \nd) \nprocedures for and the implementation of security measures. \n \nThe Aviation Security Manual contains guidance on how States may comply with the Standards and Recommended \nPractices of Annex 17 \u2013 Aviation Security to the Convention on International Civil Aviation (Doc 7300), signed at \nChicago on 7 December 1944. While the methods of compliance provided are based on generally recognized practices \nand procedures common within the international civil aviation industry, they are not the only means of compliance. Other \nmethods of meeting the Standards and Recommended Practices contained in Annex 17 may be equally appropriate. \nModification to the practices and procedures proposed in this manual may also be necessary in order to meet the varied \nlegal and administrative structures within individual States. \n \nIn order to keep this manual relevant and accurate, suggestions for improving it in terms of format, content or \npresentation are welcome. Any such recommendation or suggestion will be examined and, if found suitable, will be \nincluded in the next edition of this manual. Regular revision will ensure that this manual remains both pertinent and \naccurate. Comments concerning this manual should be addressed to: \n \nThe Secretary General \nInternational Civil Aviation Organization \n999 Robert-Bourassa Boulevard \nMontr\u00e9al, Quebec, Canada H3C 5H7 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSensitive Security Information \nDissemination, reproduction or onward distribution of this document is expressly prohibited without the consent of the originators.",

  "41": "Chapter 2 \nGENERAL PRINCIPLES \n \n2.1 \nPRIMARY OBJECTIVES \n \n2.1.1 \nThe primary objective of Member States with regard to international civil aviation security is to assure the \nprotection and safety of passengers, crew, ground personnel, the general public, aircraft and facilities of an airport \nserving civil aviation, against acts of unlawful interference perpetrated on the ground or in flight. This is carried out \nthrough a combination of measures and the marshalling of various human and material resources at international, \nnational and airport levels. \n \n2.1.2 \nTo meet this primary objective, a comprehensive organization and legal structure, with clearly defined \nresponsibilities and methods of implementation, should be established. Accordingly, through appropriate legislation, a \nState should designate an appropriate authority responsible for the development, implementation and maintenance of a \ncomprehensive policy on aviation security, hereafter referred to as the appropriate authority. The policy should \nimplement a standardized level of aviation security through measures that meet Annex 17 \u2013 Aviation Security Standards; \npreferably such measures should also reflect the Recommended Practices described in the Annex. \n \n2.1.3 \nThe policy should provide for regulations, practices and procedures that apply to \u201cnormal\u201d operating \nconditions, and for the additional measures required when there is any increase in the aviation security threat level. \n \n2.1.4 \nTo achieve a standardized level of aviation security, the security policy should be based on appropriate \nlegal provisions implemented by the many entities involved in an aviation security structure, which normally includes: \n \na) \naircraft operators; \n \nb) \nairport operators; \n \nc) \nproviders of air navigation services; \n \nd) \npolice authority and other law enforcement authorities; \n \ne) \nproviders of security services; and \n \nf) \nintelligence organizations. \n \n2.1.5 \nThe main principle that should be followed when ensuring the security of civil aviation is that the security \nmeasures implemented should be commensurate with the threat. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSensitive Security Information \nDissemination, reproduction or onward distribution of this document is expressly prohibited without the consent of the originators. \n \n2-1",

States \nreceiving sensitive aviation security information should apply the required protective measures to ensure that \nunauthorized use or disclosure is prevented. \n \n \n2.4 \nSECURITY AND FACILITATION \n \n2.4.1 \nThe adoption of practicable measures to facilitate and expedite clearance formalities is mandated by the \nConvention on International Civil Aviation, referred to as the Chicago Convention, with the objective of preventing \nunnecessary delays to air navigation. Thus, while the security of civil aviation is a top priority, States have an obligation \nto maintain an efficient air transport system. Reliable and efficient process management to prevent congestion, \nconfusion and disorder in airport terminals is also essential to the security of the system. \n \n2.4.2 \nThe facilitation of customs and immigration procedures and other border-crossing formalities are \naddressed by Annex 9 \u2013 Facilitation. Management of a State\u2019s civil aviation security system is affected by Annex 9 as it \nsets the border control procedures to be implemented by government agencies. The cooperation of airport management \nand aircraft operators is crucial in providing satisfactory facilities and services that are flexible enough to accommodate \nincreased security measures, when required, and the ever-increasing volume of passengers, baggage and cargo. \n \n2.4.3 \nAnnex 9 Standards and Recommended Practices (SARPs) also impact on State regulations for the \nevaluation and acquisition of security equipment and systems, and for airport layout and design. \n \n2.4.4 \nCreative approaches to aviation security which are effective but non-obtrusive and which are perceived by \nthe public as a logical response to new and existing threats should be supported as far as practicable. The following are \nsome elements of such approaches: \n \na) \nlevels of security control should be established according to the nature and scope of the existing \nthreat(s), and intensive controls should be selectively applied based on risk assessments; \n \nb) \ntargeting, aided by information technology, should be used to identify high-risk cases for intensive \nexamination while expediting the remaining low-risk traffic; \n \nc) \nstaffing of control points should be sufficient as to smoothly accommodate the traffic volume while \nkeeping Human Factors considerations in mind. Queues should be managed, in order to minimize \nbottlenecks in passenger flow; and",
  "46": "6-2 \nAviation Security Manual \nSensitive Security Information \nDissemination, reproduction or onward distribution of this document is expressly prohibited without the consent of the originators. \n \n \n \nd) \nwith respect to air cargo, a regulated agent regime should be employed to separate and expedite \nknown cargo shipments so that attention may be focused on unsecure cargo shipments. \n \n2.4.5 \nThe importance of security and facilitation processes working together to provide passengers with a \nseamless process should be recognized as a key link in the whole aviation security chain. When properly integrated, \nelements of the facilitation process such as machine readable travel documents (MRTDs), designed primarily to support \nimmigration control, and the identification of persons using biometric systems, can enhance the overall effectiveness of \naviation security and increase passenger safety. \n \n2.4.6 \nAnnex 9 requires Contracting States to issue only machine readable passports (MRPs) in accordance with \nthe specifications of the Machine Readable Travel Documents (Doc 9303), Part I, Volume 1. The benefits of adopting \nMRPs and other MRTDs extend beyond the obvious advantages for States of matching the identity of travellers against \nlists of high-risk persons. The physical characteristics of such documents offer strong protection against alteration or \nforgery, and adoption of a standardized format for the visual zone of an MRTD facilitates inspection by government and \naircraft operator officials, with the result that clearance of low-risk traffic is expedited, problem cases are more readily \nidentified and enforcement is improved. \n \n2.4.7 \nSpecifications and guidance material on MRTDs are published in Doc 9303 and the technical \nspecifications sections of Part 1, Part 2 and Part 3 have received endorsement from the International Organization for \nStandardization (ISO), as ISO Standards 7501-1, 7501-2 and 7501-3, respectively. \n \n \n \n2.5 \nAPPLICABILITY \n \n2.5.1 \nAviation security principles are equally applicable to international and domestic civil aviation operations. \nThis is especially true given that civil aviation has evolved into a system in which passengers from outlying points feed \ninto a hub (hub-and-spoke system) where they often transfer to other international flights. Domestic operations that feed \ninternational flights should, therefore, be protected by the same security measures as international flights. States should \ntherefore ensure that international security measures apply to domestic operations to the extent practicable, based on a \nsecurity risk assessment carried out by the relevant national authorities. \n \n2.5.2 \nAt a minimum, if it is judged that a State\u2019s domestic civil aviation operations do not warrant security \ncontrols equal to those used in international operations, there should be: \n \na) \na clear division between domestic and international operations to ensure that passengers or goods \ntransferring to international operations are subjected to security controls that meet Annex 17 SARPs; \nand \n \nb) \nthe same security controls for both types of operations, as far as practicable, by any airport providing \nservice to both international and domestic operations.",

In keeping with its provisions, States should ensure \nthat an aircraft commander is authorized to: \n \na) \nprotect the safety of the aircraft and the persons and property on board; \n \nb) \nmaintain good order and discipline on board; \n \nc) \nrestrain persons on board who may be a threat to safety; \n \nd) \ndisembark or deliver to the competent authorities persons who may be a threat to safety; \n \ne) \nnotify the authorities of a State as soon as practicable and preferably before landing in the territory of \nthat State that a person on board is under restraint; and \n \nf) \nfurnish authorities of the State with evidence and information regarding the incident that necessitated \nthe disembarkation and/or handover of a passenger. \n \n \n \n3.7 \nCONVENTION ON THE MARKING OF PLASTIC EXPLOSIVES \nFOR THE PURPOSE OF DETECTION (THE MEX CONVENTION) \n \nThe MEX Convention requires that plastic explosives be marked during the manufacturing process by one of the \ndetection agents defined in the Technical Annex to the Convention. Furthermore, the Convention requires each State \nParty to prohibit the manufacture and transport of unmarked plastic explosives and to exercise strict and effective control \nover the possession and movement of existing unmarked explosives, as well as to destroy existing stockpiles. States \nParties to the MEX Convention, or that intend to become Party, should establish provisions to ensure compliance with \nthe foregoing requirements. \n \n \n \n3.8 \nUNRULY OR DISRUPTIVE PASSENGERS \n \n3.8.1 \nIt is desirable that each State develop a policy and measures with regard to unruly and disruptive \npassengers. Articles 5 to 10 of the Tokyo Convention are useful but have a narrow jurisdiction over offences that take \nplace on board aircraft. To overcome this limitation, ICAO has published a Manual on the Legal Aspects of Unruly and \nDisruptive Passengers (Doc 10117). This manual updates ICAO Circular 288 \u2013 Guidance Material on the Legal Aspects \nof Unruly/Disruptive Passengers, as a result of the adoption of the Protocol to Amend the Convention on Offences and \nCertain Other Acts Committed on Board Aircraft (Montr\u00e9al Protocol of 2014). The manual contains guidance on \nlegislation covering acts and offences, as well as elements of an administrative sanctions regime, which will assist \nStates in implementing the appropriate legal measures to prevent and deal with unruly and disruptive passenger \nincidents. It also identifies related ICAO publications on other preventive and remedial measures in the areas of aviation \nsecurity, facilitation and cabin safety. \n \n3.8.2 \nStates should introduce legal provisions by enacting appropriate legislation with a view to requiring \noperator procedures to reflect the measures above.",

Typically, States other \nthan the State of Registry of the aircraft do not have jurisdiction over such passengers and offences committed on board \nthe aircraft outside their respective territory, except for certain offences covered by the aviation security conventions or \ninternational customary law. As recommended in Circular 288, States should take steps to include a list of specific \noffences in national law, extend jurisdiction over such offences, and provide appropriate mechanisms for addressing \nthem. \n \nNote.\u2014 Guidance material on unruly or disruptive passengers can be found in Chapter 16. \n \n \n \n3.9 \nPASSENGERS SUBJECTED TO JUDICIAL OR \nADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS \n \n3.9.1 \nPersons under arrest, as well as persons in lawful custody, inadmissible persons, deportees and persons \nsuffering from mental illness, constitute passengers who have been subjected to judicial or administrative proceedings. \nThey also form a subset of what is commonly referred to as special category passengers. Passengers who have \nundergone judicial or administrative proceedings may be considered a security risk and are subject to additional \nadministrative proceedings prior to boarding an aircraft. In some cases, certain procedures, such as the requirement for \nan escort who may be armed, will apply throughout the duration of the flight and on arrival at the destination. \n \n3.9.2 \nUnder the Chicago Convention, each Member State should develop operational requirements for \ntransporting special category passengers who must travel as a result of being subjected to judicial or administrative \nproceedings.

A State\u2019s civil aviation authority (CAA) is often designated and \nempowered to fulfil the responsibilities of the appropriate authority. \n \n5.1.2 \nEach State should notify ICAO of its designated authority and should ensure that all aviation security- \nrelated correspondence and material emanating from ICAO are passed directly to that authority as soon as they are \nreceived by the State. \n \n5.1.3 \nA major component of an NCASP and the main responsibility of the appropriate authority is aviation \nsecurity oversight. Aviation security oversight is the means by which States ensure the effective implementation of the \nsecurity-related SARPs and associated procedures contained in the Annexes to the Chicago Convention, primarily \nAnnex 17, and related ICAO documents. In this context, oversight encompasses the national obligation to: establish and \nproperly staff a security organization; develop laws, regulations, programmes, policies and procedures; and ensure that \nthese requirements are effective, are being implemented, and are sustainable. Aviation security oversight also ensures \nthat the national aviation industry provides safety and security levels at least equal to those defined by the SARPs. \n \n5.1.4 \nThis manual, together with the Aviation Security Oversight Manual (Doc 10047), provide guidance to \nStates for the establishment and implementation of their aviation security oversight systems. \n \n5.1.5 \nAn aviation security oversight mechanism is carried out through the enactment of legislation that \nestablishes a legal basis for a State\u2019s aviation security activities.

In such \ncases, a shorter, more concise impact assessment should be considered by all parties involved, especially when prompt \ndecision-making is required. In cases of extreme urgency, States may decide to proceed to implement urgent security \nmeasures first in the interests of protecting civil aviation before carrying out a formal impact assessment. \n \n5.5.1.5 \nStates should also consider conducting impact assessments when decreasing security measures. \n \n \n5.5.2 \nObjectives and benefits \n \n5.5.2.1 \nImpact assessments can provide States with information on designing measures to enhance global civil \naviation security while developing a sustainable aviation security system and framework, as well as reaching an \nacceptable balance between the needs for security and facilitation. Such assessments may therefore contribute towards \nthe adoption of risk-based, outcome-focused, practical and, above all, sustainable security measures. \n \n5.5.2.2 \nTo achieve sustainability in aviation security, States should ensure that the resources (e.g. financial, \nexisting and new staff/manpower and equipment) necessary to implement new and/or modified measures are in balance \nwith the expected outcomes of these measures. This also implies that positive outcomes engendered by new and/or \nmodified measures should not be outweighed by adverse effects on other areas of civil aviation. Impact assessments \nmay therefore further promote the sustainability of aviation systems by ensuring that security measures are \ncommensurate with the threat they intend to counter and do not negatively affect other areas or measures in place. \nIndeed, measures whereby a disproportionate amount of resources is allocated, may strain systems and are seldom \nsustainable in the medium to long term. \n \nConsultative process \n \n5.5.2.3 \nWhen conducting an impact assessment, States should engage in a consultative process with all \nstakeholders involved.

For instance, an impact \nassessment should be conducted prior to purchasing new equipment or upgrading existing equipment, \nor prior to implementing measures selected from a set of available unpredictable security measures. \n \n \nStakeholders \n \n5.5.3.2 \nStates should involve all stakeholders concerned in the impact assessment process as early as practicable \nthrough a consultative process, and include, inter alia, the following: \n \na) \nentities responsible for implementation; \n \nb) \nentities possibly impacted by implementation (e.g. aircraft operators when the introduction of new \nand/or modified security measures impacts the flow of passengers at points of transfer, which may \naffect minimum connection time); \n \nc) \nother relevant government agencies (e.g. aviation safety, ATS providers, agencies responsible for \ndata protection, health and safety); and/or \n \nd) \nother States which may be impacted by the measures. \n \n5.5.3.3 \nThe consultative process should be flexible enough to allow States to choose the most appropriate method \nof cooperation based on the level of involvement of each stakeholder or on how new and/or modified security measures \nmay affect them.

Those carrying out impact assessments should therefore take \ninto consideration which areas or elements of assessments can be based on data and which elements may only be \nappraised based on descriptive information. It is equally important to recognize and acknowledge gaps in evidence and \nhow these may be addressed.

In \nsome cases, the results of an assessment can be quantified where measuring tools and mechanisms are used, for \nexample, when measuring throughputs. In others, for example, measuring passenger satisfaction, a more subtle \nmeasurement methodology may be required, possibly combining quantitative and qualitative data collection and analysis. \n \n5.5.4.7 \nWhen designing an impact assessment, States should define early on where quantitative or qualitative \nmeasurement tools are required and available. They should also identify areas for which a quantitative analysis is \ncurrently not feasible (e.g. introducing some measures in airport A may have impacts on airport B or other stakeholders \nthat cannot be assessed numerically, because these impacts are interconnected and complex).

States should further analyse the results of impact \nassessments by ensuring that the following criteria have been addressed: \n \na) \nSecurity effectiveness against the State\u2019s risk assessment: Are the proposed measures expected to \nbe effective against the assessed risk? Will the introduction of the proposed measures unduly hinder \npassenger flow while bringing minimal additional security value? \n \nb) \nProportionality: Are the proposed measures commensurate with comparable measures implemented \nwithin the existing aviation security system? If not, why? Will the proposed measures introduce \ndistortion and unsustainability within the security system? Is the measure intended to be for a defined \nperiod of time? \n \nc) \nAppropriate level and type of action: Does the threat require international/regional regulation or are \nnational/local measures sufficient? Are the proposed measures of sufficiently high level to change \nregulations or can they be addressed and implemented through other means (e.g. training)? Have \nconfidentiality requirements been duly considered? Do the proposed measures require changes to \nregulations or legislation?",

The programme could comprise a single document containing current aviation \nsecurity requirements and procedures or, alternatively, multiple documents reflecting requirements and procedures \nemanating from various national laws, regulations, and programmes. If multiple documents are used, States should \nestablish a mechanism, such as a cross-reference table, to facilitate the use of all relevant documents and easily locate \npertinent sections and policies of the NCASP.

Quality assurance audits and inspections should be conducted to identify non- \ncompliance with regulatory requirements as well as to evaluate the overall security system. As part of \nquality control, surveys, tests and exercises should be conducted to determine deficiencies and \nweaknesses in operating procedures, equipment, facilities and personnel, and to identify corrective \nactions in a timely manner. \n \nb) \nProgramme adjustment. The aviation security programme of a State, airport or aircraft operator, ATS \nprovider, regulated agent or other relevant entity should require minor adjustments from time to time \nand occasional major modifications. Changes should be dictated by information gathered as a result of \nthreat assessments, surveys or inspections. New construction or environment, changes in aircraft and \nairport operations and other activities may also require programme adjustments, in order to maintain \neffectiveness. As other States may have specific and ongoing requirements for flights to a State in the \nmidst of the development or amendment of an NCASP, it is sometimes necessary to facilitate \nimplementation of such requirements with adjustments to the programme, provided these are not \ninconsistent with State policy. Modifications may also arise out of the investigation and review of an \noccurrence. The regular use of various quality control mechanisms and performance assessment tools \nshould highlight the strengths and weaknesses of an NCASP, while frequent minor adjustments \nshould continuously address new security needs or deficiencies, reducing the necessity for major \noverhauls of the programme and its procedures. \n \nc) \nEvaluation, installation and maintenance of security systems and devices.

Quality control measures may be defined as the techniques and activities used to assess a State\u2019s aviation \nsecurity system and, whenever required, to resolve identified findings. \n \nNote.\u2014 A State\u2019s aviation security oversight system is described in the Aviation Security Oversight \nManual \u2013 The Establishment and Management of a State Aviation Security Oversight System (Doc 10047). \n \n7.1.2 \nIn order to implement quality control measures, each State should require its appropriate authority to \ndevelop, implement and maintain an NQCP, to determine compliance with and validate the effectiveness of its NCASP. \nThe main objectives of the NQCP should be to: \n \na) \nmonitor the effectiveness of aviation security measures implemented by all entities that perform \nsecurity functions and to determine the level of compliance with applicable State regulations and the \nNCASP; \n \nb) \nvalidate the effectiveness of national regulations and the NCASP; \n \nc) \nidentify any findings in the implementation of security measures and require appropriate corrective \nactions; and \n \nd) \nidentify all aspects of security measures that may need changes in aviation security regulations, the \nNCASP and/or the means of implementation. \n \n7.1.3 \nThe NQCP should be developed and maintained in cooperation with all entities involved in implementing \naviation security measures. Appropriate training should be provided to any entity and/or person that could be subjected \nto quality control activities. \n \n7.1.4 \nStates\u2019 quality control programmes may be tailored to reflect variations in local circumstances, taking into \naccount the nature of airport and aircraft operations. The priorities and frequency of monitoring should be determined on \nthe basis of risk assessment carried out by the relevant authorities. \n \nNote.\u2014 Information on threat and risk assessment can be found in Chapter 9. \n \n \n \n \n \nSensitive Security Information \nDissemination, reproduction or onward distribution of this document is expressly prohibited without the consent of the originators. \n \n7-1",

A high level of expertise will enable them to \nperform in a more effective and efficient manner, thus enhancing the credibility of the State\u2019s aviation security monitoring \nsystem. \n \n7.2.2.2 \nSuch national aviation security inspectors should be required to maintain strict confidentiality with respect \nto the information gathered during their monitoring activities. Additionally, they should be provided with the legal power \nthey need to carry out their activities. \n \n \n7.2.3 \nIndependence \n \n7.2.3.1 \nQuality control measures should be fair, impartial, robust, reliable and can be consistently repeated in \norder to encourage cooperation from the entities being monitored, and to ensure that the results are accepted. This will \nassist with ensuring that any corrective action plans are implemented effectively. Independence is therefore an essential \ntrait of the monitoring process. \n \n7.2.3.2 \nThe management, setting of priorities and organization of the NQCP should be operationally independent \nfrom the entities and persons responsible for the implementation of the measures taken under the NCASP. Moreover, \nquality control personnel should be independent from the entities being monitored and free of any commercial or \noperational influences. \n \n \n7.2.4 \nScope and means \n \n7.2.4.1 \nAn NQCP should cover different types of quality control activities, including audits, inspections and security \ntests, to determine the overall level of compliance with national requirements and to evaluate security needs in different \nareas. \n \n7.2.4.2 \nQuality control activities should cover all aspects of an NCASP, including the organization of the national \naviation security system, and the security measures in place for all government organizations or other entities involved in \nthe implementation of such measures. \n \n7.2.4.3 \nAll entities with aviation security responsibilities should be subjected to monitoring activities, including \nforeign aircraft operators operating from airports within the State, to ensure their compliance with the national regulations \nand the NCASP.",

Standardization should apply to the: \ndefinition of tasks; planning, preparation, on-site activities, classification of findings and completion and dissemination of \nthe report, including any recommended corrective actions, i.e. all national aviation security inspectors should perform in \nthe same manner. Measures should be robust, reliable and consistently repeatable. \n \n7.2.5.2 \nCompliance monitoring activities should be based on information gathered by means of observations, \ninterviews, review of documents and verifications. Data gathered in a standardized way should be collated, analysed \nand disseminated promptly for follow-up action. The causes and patterns resulting from such analyses should be \nprovided to those with a need-to-know to prepare corrective action plans and propose possible adjustments to the \nprogrammes/regulations. Information on the level of compliance by aircraft and airport operators and other relevant \nentities should be used in defining priorities and identifying trends. Compliance monitoring activities undertaken should \ninclude both announced and unannounced activities. Results will typically fall into the following categories; \n \na) \npolicy and/or regulation; \n \nb) \nprocedural (i.e. the application or implementation of a policy or regulation); \n \nc) \nequipment (i.e. the technology employed has failed to function as specified); \n \nd) \nHuman Factors (e.g. training, environment and distractions); \n \n7.2.5.3 \nGiven the sensitivity of aviation security-related information, quality control activity reports and findings \nshould be assigned a security classification in accordance with each State\u2019s regulations, as necessary. \n \n \n7.2.6 \nCorrective actions \n \n7.2.6.1 \nDocumented findings should require corrective action plans as quickly as appropriate. Certain findings may \npreclude immediate resolution. In all cases, a corrective action plan should be established by the appropriate authority. \n \n7.2.6.2 \nAn NQCP should describe the means by which corrective action plans are established, managed and \nsigned off as complete so that there is no ambiguity in the process. The process should be well known and understood \nby all parties. \n \n \n7.2.7 \nInternal quality control measures \n \n7.2.7.1 \nAll entities responsible for implementing security measures should establish, implement and maintain a \nwritten security programme that meets the requirements of the State NCASP. \n \n7.2.7.2 \nAll entities involved in the implementation of security measures should adopt tailored internal quality \ncontrol programmes that include quality control activities consistent with their operations; these measures should be \nemployed at a national level. A key skill of those performing internal quality control measures should be a good working \nknowledge of operational areas, the security processes and associated regulations.",

Additionally, the risk \nfrom carrying out security tests should be evaluated (e.g. impact assessment in case of loss of control of the test piece), \nfor example, the testing of an automated hold baggage system, if not correctly managed, could lead to a test object \nboarding an aircraft and causing significant operational delays. \n \n7.6.1.9 \nThe quality and quantity of security tests should be sufficient to provide robust data that can provide for \ntrend analysis (i.e. too few tests may not provide statistically valid results).

Factors that should be taken into account include masking of IED components by other items carried, \nsuperimposition of other items carried in the container and which distractors (e.g. bottle of water, organic material and \nclutter items), if any, should be included. \n \n7.6.3.14 \nWhen transporting test objects through screening checkpoints (i.e. when not in use as part of security \ntesting activities at those particular checkpoints), they may be presented to the supervisor on duty in a disassembled \nform and/or via an approved exemption process, and confirmation of the inert nature of the test object should be \nprovided. \n \n \n\u201cSharp\u201d test objects \n \n7.6.3.15 \n\u201cSharp\u201d test objects should be designed in accordance with national requirements to: \n \na) \nvisually simulate prohibited items such as knives, cutting tools, blades and scissors to test the ability of \nscreeners to identify sharp items on X-ray images; and/or \n \nb) \nmatch the magnetic signature of a metal item capable of triggering an alarm when using metal \ndetection equipment (e.g. hand-held metal detectors and walk-through metal detectors) and/or body \nscanners at normal operational setting.

Despite \nenhancements to the security system, terrorists continue to develop new techniques and weapons in hopes of \ncircumventing security measures. In general, it is assessed that in selecting a target for attack, terrorists are likely to \npursue the following objectives: \n \na)  inflicting mass casualties; \n \nb)  causing economic disruption; \n \nc) \nmaking a symbolic statement; and \n \nd)  generating public anxiety. \n \n9.1.3.2 \nThese objectives may lead to a variety of forms of attack on the aviation system. Terrorists have shown \nthemselves to be innovative and may seek out a wider range of modus operandi and targets, influenced by the \navailability and vulnerability of such targets and the opportunity for success in the terms set out above. The likelihood or \nthreat of an attack should be assessed in terms of the motivation and intent of terrorists to carry out such an attack and \ntheir capability (skill set, resources, etc.) to do so. \n \n \nGlobal threat \n \n9.1.3.3 \nAs national civil aviation systems are linked to international aviation networks, so is the threat to civil \naviation. While global in nature, threat levels may nonetheless differ according to the location around the world. Regional, \nnational, and even local variations are therefore critical variables that States should take into consideration when \nassessing threats. \n \n9.1.3.4 \nStates should be aware of the vulnerabilities and consequences associated with threats to civil aviation. \nTerrorists are known to continuously seek to identify the perceived limitations of aviation security measures and exploit \nremaining vulnerabilities within the global system. Threats may often take the most convenient path through the system, \nwhether that path be convenient because of location, its connections to other areas of the system, or known \nweaknesses in that part of the global system. Therefore, States and aviation organizations should pay close attention to \nthreats to aviation, even when they do not consider themselves or their citizens to be directly at risk. \n \n \nGlobal consequences \n \n9.1.3.5 \nGiven the global character of the terrorist threat to international civil aviation, terrorist attacks upon the \naviation system may have global consequences. Public anxiety and economic disruption caused by a terrorist attack \nmay manifest themselves well beyond the borders of States that are the sites of terrorist attacks. The global \nconsequences of terrorist attacks on the aviation system should therefore also be considered when assessing the \nreasonable worst-case scenario consequences of any threat.",

The \nsecurity measures at airports described herein should be applied consistently and effectively, and should be readily \nchangeable in response to any increased security threat. Randomness and unpredictability should also be applied to \nreinforce the deterrent effect of security measures. \n \nNote.\u2014 Airport management should promote, develop and implement measures to establishing an \neffective security culture in the airport environment. More information on security culture can be found in Chapter 9. \n \n11.1.2 \nStates should ensure that airport design requirements, including architectural and infrastructure-related \nrequirements necessary for the implementation of security measures in the NCASP, are integrated into the design and \nconstruction of new facilities and alterations to existing facilities at airports. \n \n11.1.3 \nWhen designing airport facilities, planners should adopt a holistic approach to address security concerns \nand facilitate the effective implementation of security measures, which include the design of security systems and \noperational processes, and the deployment of security personnel. \n \n11.1.4 \nSecurity measures should be carried out with a view to minimizing, as much as practicable, any disruptions \nto passengers and the public, while maintaining an optimized level of aircraft and airport operators operations.

  "182": "11-2 \nAviation Security Manual \nSensitive Security Information \nDissemination, reproduction or onward distribution of this document is expressly prohibited without the consent of the originators. \n \n \n \n \nc) \naccess control; and \n \nd) \nscreening and security control regime for non-passengers and the items they carry entering and/or \nwithin security restricted areas. \n \n11.2.1.2 \nThe type of protective measures designed to safeguard an airport against an act of unlawful interference \nshould be based on a risk assessment conducted by the relevant national authority. More information on access control \nand terminal protection can be found in Appendix 15. \n \n11.2.2 \nAirport perimeter protection \n \n11.2.2.1 \nThe purposes of a fence are to demarcate the perimeter, deter unauthorized access, delay intrusion and \naid in the detection of intrusion. These purposes should be considered during the design of an airport fence and should \nbe commensurate with the assessed risk from unauthorized intrusion. \n \n11.2.2.2 \nThe level of protection offered by a fence will depend on its height, method of construction, the material \nused and any additional security features used to increase its performance or effectiveness, such as barbed wire topping, \na perimeter intrusion detection system (PIDS), lighting or a closed-circuit television (CCTV) system. More information on \nthe use of CCTV systems as a security tool can be found in Appendix 18. \n \n11.2.2.3 \nFences between the landside and airside should be physical obstructions that are clearly visible to the \ngeneral public and deny unauthorized access. Fencing should be of sufficient height to deter scaling. A minimum height \nof 2.44 m or 8 ft is recommended, augmented by inclined barbed wire or razor-taped wire. The installation of a fence \nshould prevent a person from pulling it up at the bottom and crawling or burrowing under. Fences may be buried into the \nground or affixed to a concrete base or sill. There may be legal implications if barbed or razor-taped wires are used in \nareas to which the public has access, and legal advice on the matter should be sought. \n \n11.2.2.4 \nDue to safety and operational reasons, at certain locations on the perimeter, particularly the take-off and \nlanding runway thresholds, metal fences cannot be used, since they might disrupt the operation of navigation aids. In \nthis case, special fencing materials or construction methods may be required, such as the use of non-metallic and \nfrangible fencing material, or living fences, i.e. thorny plants. \n \n11.2.2.5 \nThe entire fence area should, if possible, be visible to resident or patrolling guards. It may prove necessary \nto shorten the perimeter in places to avoid pockets in the fenced area which could otherwise be out of sight. This not \nonly applies to walls and opaque fences but also to transparent fences, since these commonly become opaque when \nviewed from an oblique angle. Alternatively, a CCTV system may be used. Transparent fences are usually preferable to \nopaque fences as they allow guards to see outside the protected area. \n \n11.2.2.6 \nIn selecting the most appropriate fencing material, consideration should be given to the other components \nof a perimeter security system. For example, if a fence is used with a PIDS, and is supported by appropriate perimeter \nlighting, a CCTV system, warning signs and frequent patrols, it may be possible to use a more general type of security \nfence. In areas where such systems are not available, a higher grade security fence should be used to increase the \nlength of time it may take an intruder to cut through or climb the fence as well as augmenting the level of difficulty of \ndoing so. \n \n11.2.2.7 \nConsideration should be given to the ongoing maintenance of the fence and the ease of replacement of \nsections that become damaged or unserviceable such as through corrosion. The use of galvanized or plastic-coated \nfencing may be most appropriate in locations where corrosion is likely to be a problem.",
  "183": "Chapter 11. \nAirport security \n11-3 \nSensitive Security Information \nDissemination, reproduction or onward distribution of this document is expressly prohibited without the consent of the originators. \n \n \n \n \n11.2.2.8 \nThe type of fence chosen should reflect the type of threat expected and be compatible with the terrain and \nwith any requirement for intrusion detection and/or CCTV systems. The fence should, whenever possible, be run in \nstraight lines for ease of erection and surveillance. Junctions where a fence changes direction are usually easier to climb \nand should therefore be kept to a minimum. As much as possible, junctions that turn outwards should be avoided as \nthese are the easiest to scale. \n \n11.2.2.9 \nWhenever possible, the ground on both sides of a perimeter fence should be cleared in order to establish \nan exclusion zone (a distance of about 3 m from the fence is recommended) that would remove cover for any intruders, \nand should be kept clear of obstructions, such as lamp posts, signposts, equipment, vehicles, and trees, that may assist \nan intruder to climb the fence. The fence may have to be set back from the actual site boundary to leave an \nunobstructed area outside the fence. \n \n11.2.2.10 \nA patrol road suitable for vehicles should be constructed alongside the fence to permit the passage of \nmotorized patrols, ideally on both the landside and airside but if not both then definitely the airside. The road should be \nwell drained and kept free of obstacles at all times. \n \n11.2.2.11 \nVulnerable points and/or key airport installations, such as the fuel farm and air navigation facilities, located \non the airside within the aerodrome enclosure should be surrounded by an appropriate perimeter fence constructed to at \nleast the same technical specifications as the aerodrome land perimeter described above. \n \n11.2.2.12 \nThe effectiveness of any security perimeter will depend to a large extent on the level of security at the \npoints of entry. Gates should be constructed to the same security standard as perimeter fences, and some form of \naccess control should be in place. Without such control, the security of the entire fence will be negated. \n \n \nPerimeter intrusion detection and CCTV systems \n \n11.2.2.13 \nGenerally, fencing systems are not able to detect intrusion and a PIDS should therefore form part of an \noverall perimeter security system. A PIDS is an electronic device designed to discern the entry or attempted entry of an \nintruder across the external perimeter or protected area, identify the location and generate an alarm. When properly \ndeployed, such a system can enhance the effectiveness of other perimeter defences, but is prone to false alarms and \nshould therefore be used with an alarm verification system such as CCTV. A PIDS may be installed as a covert device, \nor overtly to act as a deterrent. \n \n11.2.2.14 \nThe use of a CCTV system for surveillance may save on human resources while covering large sites or \nperimeters, especially when used in conjunction with intrusion detection and automated access control systems, and \nmay supplement or extend an existing security system. Such a system also enhances the effectiveness of perimeter \nsecurity, particularly when used to verify alarms activated by a PIDS. A CCTV system may also improve working \nconditions for security guards by allowing them to avoid exposure to danger as well as inclement weather and other \ninconveniences of routine patrolling. A system\u2019s effectiveness will depend, however, on the selection of suitable \nequipment and the method of installation. More information on a PIDS and on CCTV systems is provided in \nAppendix 18. \n \n \nEmergency gates \n \n11.2.2.15 \nEmergency gates, also known as crash gates, are often installed in an airport\u2019s perimeter fence to allow \nthe quick access or egress of emergency service vehicles to on-airport or off-airport aircraft accidents. Crash gates",

The fitting of frangible links in locking systems is a useful means of \nallowing emergency vehicles access or egress while not compromising security. Consideration should also be given to \nequipping such gates with intrusion detection systems. \n \n \nSecurity lighting \n \n11.2.2.16 \nSecurity lighting can offer a high degree of deterrence for potential intruders, in addition to providing the \nillumination necessary for effective surveillance, either by guards, motorized patrols or indirectly through a CCTV system. \nThere are various types of security lighting to meet particular applications: \n \na) \nperimeter lighting is designed to cast a strong light on the perimeter, with overhead lamps or low- \nmounted lamps that create a glare effect to dazzle and deter intruders. If the latter are used, care \nshould be taken to ensure that they do not create a nuisance or hazard to aircraft; \n \nb) \narea lighting is intended to illuminate areas inside the perimeter through which intruders may cross in \norder to reach their objectives. This increases the guards\u2019 ability to detect intruders and acts as a \npowerful deterrent. Ideally, the illumination should be even and without shadows. Every part of each \narea to be illuminated should be lit by at least two lights to guard against lamp failure; \n \nc) \nlocal lighting is used to illuminate those areas inadequately covered by area lighting and which might \nconceal an intruder. Small bulkhead lights, tough and resistant to interference, should be used. \nFluorescent or tungsten-halogen lamps may be used as miniature floodlights. All dark spots should be \neliminated. Roofs, fire escapes and emergency exits should be illuminated by such local lighting; and \n \nd) \nfloodlighting is designed to illuminate surfaces such as buildings and fences that intruders may pass in \nfront of to reach their objectives. At the low illumination levels typical of a security lighting situation, the \neyes rely mainly on the ability to recognize outline shapes. A moving silhouette can readily be seen \nagainst an illuminated wall, preferably painted white or some other light colour. \n \n11.2.2.17 \nSecurity lighting acts as a particularly good low-cost deterrent as a low level of illumination will deter most \npotential intruders and vandals. If a CCTV system is installed, the lighting level and uniformity should be such that they \nhelp to present a clear monitor picture to security guards. \n \n11.2.2.18 \nThe frequent inspection and maintenance of security lamps are necessary as light output decreases \nsignificantly after prolonged use. Lamps requiring long warm-up periods are unsuitable for certain security lighting \napplications. Time switches, movement sensors or photo-electric sensors may be useful for the control of security \nlighting, but the latter are vulnerable to deliberate interference. \n \n \n11.2.3 \nAirside and security restricted areas \n \n11.2.3.1 \nThe airside is that part of an airport where aircraft and supporting vehicles normally move about, together \nwith the adjacent terrain and buildings or portions thereof, access to which is controlled. \n \n11.2.3.2 \nSecurity restricted areas should be established at each airport serving civil aviation designated by the \nState, according to the results of security risk assessments carried out by the relevant national authorities. More \ninformation on security risk assessments can be found in Appendix 37.",

Such areas will normally include, inter alia, all \ncommercial aviation passenger departure areas between the screening checkpoint and the aircraft, the ramp, baggage \nmake-up areas, including those where aircraft are being brought into service and screened baggage and cargo are \npresent, cargo sheds, mail centres, airside catering and aircraft cleaning premises. \n \n \n11.2.3.4 \nIn keeping with the key security principle of defence in-depth, whereby limited security resources are \nallocated for the protection of the most likely target, with layers of defence radiating outward, States should limit the size \nof their security restricted areas to an expanse that can be effectively secured and which ensures that resources are not \ntoo widespread. \n \n11.2.3.5 \nSecurity restricted areas should therefore be kept as small as possible, in proportion to the level of aircraft \noperations and the quantity of security resources. Resources should be allocated to the most likely targets in a manner \nthat is effective and in line with the current threat assessment level. This approach allows, for example, the \nimplementation of higher access control standards for those persons and vehicles that are required to approach and \nservice an aircraft, than for all vehicles moving around the airside, as shown in Figure 11-1. \n \n11.2.3.6 \nAccess points from public areas to security restricted areas should be kept to a minimum and should have \neffective access control measures or be kept locked. Access by staff to security restricted areas should be limited to \nthose with a clear operational need to enter by virtue of their duties. Similar controls should apply to vehicles, with \naccess granted to only those vehicles clearly required for operations.

The job \nposition or title should not be used as the criterion for establishing the need for a permit. \n \n11.2.6.7 \nPersons requiring a permit should be obliged to collect it personally, in order that the photograph and \nsignature and other personal features such as personal identification numbers may be verified. The recipient should be \nacquainted with the conditions of issuance and should sign a certificate to that effect. \n \n11.2.6.8 \nIt is to be expected that persons ceasing to work at an airport will on occasion leave with their permits. \nProvision should be made to immediately recover a permit when a holder ceases to need the access it affords, in \nparticular when the term of employment ends or there is a transfer to other duties or locations. \n \n11.2.6.9 \nIn order to reduce the possibility of misuse, permits should have a defined period of validity that should not \nexceed two years. Permit renewal should adhere to a schedule based on the number of renewals required, and the \nprocess should allow sufficient lead time to cater to administration and production needs while ensuring that no permits \nremain in use after their expiry date. This requirement may pose administrative difficulties for airports with large numbers \nof workers, unless they establish staggered periods of validity. For example, re-issue may be conducted progressively \nover a period of time, so that a certain number of permits are due for renewal each month or each quarter. \n \n11.2.6.10 \nIt is inevitable that, on occasion, permits will be lost. The loss or theft of a permit should be reported \nimmediately in person, by telephone and in writing to the sponsor and to the issuing authority. The issuing authority \nshould have a system in place to notify all concerned that the permit is no longer valid, and this notification should be \nissued immediately or as soon as possible on receipt of the loss or theft report. \n \n11.2.6.11 \nLosses should be recorded and documented by the issuing authority. When the nature or number of losses \nof unexpired permits is such that the credibility of the permit system in its entirety is undermined, the current issuance of \npermits should be withdrawn and replaced, system wide, by a new one, preferably bearing a new design or layout.",

Permits should clearly display the essential information required by the control point officer in \norder to establish the bona fides of the permit holder. To facilitate visual inspection, permits should be designed for \ndisplay in a prominent position on the holder\u2019s outer garment. \n \n11.2.6.17 \nThere are significant security advantages in adopting permits that include a photograph of the holder, \nmainly because this acts as a deterrent against unauthorized use by another individual. Photographs should be taken \nagainst a contrasting backdrop, with the face photographed in maximum close-up and occupying at least one-third of the \npermit\u2019s dimensions. For convenience and ease of inspection, permits should be 85 mm x 55 mm, that is, about credit \ncard size. Permit designs should incorporate the following features: \n \na) \nforgery prevention achieved by using an intricate background or fine-line guilloche design. The \nbackground is that part of the obverse of a permit that is not occupied by the photograph. A guilloche \nis a continuous geometric pattern over the entire obverse of a permit, including the photograph; \n \nb) \naid recognition achieved by using a bold overall motif printed over the background; and \n \nc) \nan effective lamination process and the use of security printing on the surface of the laminate that is \nonly visible when viewed at an oblique angle, thus impeding photo substitution. \n \n11.2.6.18 \nThe obverse of a permit should contain, at a minimum, the following information: \n \na) \nexpiry date clearly stating numerically the month and year of expiry of the permit, preferably in a \ndifferent colour to highlight the information.

In order to assure that temporary permits are not issued for an extended time \nperiod, their validity should be limited (e.g. 30 days). \n \n11.2.6.20 \nThe airport security officer should issue a short-term or temporary permit, on which the period of validity is \nclearly stated, to each official guest and non-resident professional or technician requiring access to airside or security \nrestricted areas in order to perform assigned tasks. Temporary permits need to incorporate a photograph, and indicate \nwhat special equipment the holder is authorized to convey into airside or security restricted areas. Persons requesting \ntemporary permits should provide a government-issued photographic identification such as a passport or driver\u2019s licence, \nas well as proper accreditations before being issued the temporary permit. \n \n11.2.6.21 \nAll temporary permits should be recovered by the issuing authority, with adequate records being \nmaintained to facilitate this process and provide for protection against misuse.

The ability to \ncontrol access effectively and efficiently needs to be factored into wider airport design and into the design of all entry \nand egress points, including vehicle checkpoints. Such access controls may be applied separately or in combination with \nother measures, both for access to security restricted areas and for access to particularly sensitive parts of an airport \nsuch as baggage make-up areas containing screened hold baggage, and ramp areas where commercial aircraft are in \nservice. \n \n \nHigh-visibility measures \n \n11.3.6.11 \nStates may consider implementing high-visibility measures that involve the deployment of overt security \ncontrols in a highly visible manner in order to provide an additional deterrent effect and to assist detection by inducing a \nreaction in persons of potential concern. States could consider using a combination of security controls implemented \nunpredictably through a joint team of, for example, police, military and security officers, as well as detection dogs. Such \na joint team may provide enhanced patrols and surveillance, screening, engagement with non-passengers and other \nsecurity controls. Unpredictable high-visibility measures can serve as an additional risk mitigation tool that augments \nbaseline security measures, promoting confidence and deterrence. \n \nNote.\u2014 Information on screening methods, equipment and technology can be found in [11.5]. \n \n \n \n11.4 \nSCREENING OF VEHICLES AND SUPPLIES CONVEYED \nIN SECURITY RESTRICTED AREAS \n \n \n11.4.1 \nScope \n \nVehicles and items carried within them should be subjected to screening or other appropriate security controls before \nentering a security restricted area, in accordance with a risk assessment carried out by the relevant national authorities.",

In most cases, \nprocessing time is cumulative, as passengers are stopped for additional security checks. Additional security checks \nshould be performed in a way that the normal flow of passengers is not interrupted and without compromising the \neffectiveness of the screening process. If not properly managed, security measures at airports may adversely impact \npassenger flow. \n \n11.5.3.18 \nInefficient security checks can adversely affect the \u201con-time\u201d performance of aircraft operations. Moreover, \nthe resulting congestion at passenger screening checkpoints may be exploited by would-be perpetrators to circumvent \nthe system, or to attack a crowded area. \n \n11.5.3.19 \nWhile it is not often possible to accelerate the screening process, methods such as extending lines into \nsingle files, dedicating airport agents to organize passenger traffic and answer questions, assigning more screeners at \neach screening checkpoint, and optimizing the space utilization are ways to improve the passengers\u2019 impressions of \nairport security. \n \n11.5.3.20 \nOne requirement for efficient security processing is the deployment of a sufficient number of properly \ntrained screeners. Screener training should focus not only on the necessary technical skills, but on the competencies \nneeded for customer service, basic conflict resolution and passenger risk assessment. \n \n11.5.3.21 \nAdditionally, tables of an appropriate length should be located in front of the cabin baggage screening \nequipment for passengers to remove their coats and other personal items, as well as any specific items in their cabin \nbaggage that require separate inspection. \n \n11.5.3.22 \nSufficient space also should be created at a passenger screening checkpoint to avoid congestion \ndownstream of a WTMD, especially when passengers generate a WTMD alarm or are selected for a random search. \nThis area should be kept clear so that security cleared passengers can retrieve their belongings and leave the \npassenger screening checkpoint as quickly as possible. With the same logic in mind, sufficient space should be \nallocated to X-ray equipment, particularly the conveyor belt, so that items to be searched do not obstruct other articles of \ncabin baggage. To that end, a separate table should be used for manual searches and explosive trace inspections of \ncabin baggage. This practice should not only improve passenger flow, but should ensure greater privacy for passengers \nwhose personal belongings need to be inspected. \n \nSecurity awareness and facilitation \n \n11.5.3.23 \nPassenger education and advance notice through, for example, aircraft operators or airports, or press \nreleases and the media are essential to ensure that passengers receive quality service and optimum facilitation. \n \n11.5.3.24 \nThe travelling public should be generally aware of the aviation security rules, particularly as applied to \npassenger terminals and the role that passengers can play in deterring acts of unlawful interference. Periodic \nannouncements should be made over the public address system, informing passengers and members of the public of \nthe basic security procedures that apply to them, and specifically their obligation to not leave baggage unattended and to \nimmediately report any suspicious activity to the police or security services. \n \n11.5.3.25 \nAnnouncements, signs or videos should be used in and around security checkpoints to boost awareness of \nthe screening procedures. Such efforts may help prepare passengers for this process by informing them about articles \nthat are restricted or prohibited, and by explaining the general procedures. Informative signs and videos help reduce \npassenger confusion arising from differing preboard screening measures at different locations.

Examples of such signs can be found in Appendix 21. Some signs may be used for access control \npurposes, and others to inform the public of aviation security rules. \n \n11.5.3.27 \nThe term restricted area is commonly used in signage. Security area or other terms that convey a similar \nmeaning may be equally suitable. They should, however, reflect the terms used in the empowering legislation and fulfil \nother legal requirements. The inclusion of a statement citing the legal authority and the title of the person authorized to \ndesignate security restricted areas is often necessary to meet legislative requirements. \n \n11.5.3.28 \nAlthough many air travel tickets are sold remotely by travel agents, over the telephone and increasingly \nthrough the Internet, on-airport ticketing and check-in staff may play a role in the security function by being trained to \nidentify individuals whom the appropriate authority indicates should be subject to additional or enhanced scrutiny before \nboarding an aircraft and act accordingly. \n \n11.5.3.29 \nWhen modifying the list of prohibited items for passengers and cabin baggage, authorities should consider \nthe possible impact this could have on operational and commercial aspects, as well as passenger facilitation. Many \npassengers use their travel time to work, particularly while waiting between flights, and contemporary communication \ndevices such as laptop computers and cellular telephones are essential. Such items are often expensive and \npassengers are reluctant to place them in hold baggage because of the risk of theft or damage. The more that \npassengers need to transfer articles to hold baggage because of valid security reasons, the more safety may be \ncompromised, and the harder it becomes for passengers to comply with hold baggage weight limits. It may also \ngenerate tension, frustration and ultimately unruly behaviours from passengers, which in turn could create a hostile \nenvironment prone to security issues. \n \n \n11.5.4 \nPassenger screening \n \n11.5.4.1 \nThe screening of persons entering the security restricted area or sterile area of an airport is an essential \npart of aviation security. Technical equipment used for the screening of persons and baggage should be assessed by \nthe appropriate authority to determine its benefits and limitations. WTMDs and HHMDs, for example, cannot detect non- \nmetallic weapons and explosives. All screening technology equipment should therefore be used in accordance with the \nconcept of operation provided by the manufacturer or the supplier. \n \n11.5.4.2 \nTo compensate for the limitations of screening technologies and equipment (e.g. WTMDs) and strengthen \nthe overall screening performance of passenger screening checkpoints, States should apply random manual searches \nfor screened passengers. In addition to passengers who generate an alarm, manual searches should be carried out on a \nproportion of passengers who do not activate the equipment\u2019s alarm (e.g. an alarm could be randomly generated by the \nWTMD for this purpose). \n \n11.5.4.3 \nBody scanners may be used as a primary method for passenger screening, or to complement other \nprimary screening methods such as WTMDs. When used to complement WTMDs, body scanners should be applied to \npassengers who generate an alarm, and on a number of passengers who do not activate the WTMD alarm. \n \n11.5.4.4 \nOnly on satisfactory completion of any additional procedures and similar processing of all hand-carried \nitems should an individual be permitted to proceed beyond the passenger screening checkpoint.",

Any person who cannot be \nsatisfactorily cleared after completing the entire screening process, including a manual search, should be denied entry \ninto security restricted areas. \n \n11.5.4.6 \nIn addition to mandatory searches, additional screening, including a manual search, should always be \nperformed on any person who displays undue nervousness, or appears to be attempting to evade a search, or behaves \nin a way that suggests concealment of a restricted article. \n \n11.5.5 \nRandom and unpredictable screening \nof a proportion of passengers \n \n11.5.5.1 \nA proportion of passengers together with the items they carry should be subjected to secondary screening \nusing the principles of randomness and unpredictability, insofar as this is practicable. The screening methods to be \napplied may include manual search, other screening technology equipment (e.g. ETD), or a combination thereof. The \nproportion of passengers to be subjected to these measures should be based on a combination of the following criteria: \n \na) \nnational and local level of threat (when the threat level is raised for a limited period of time, the \nproportion of passengers to be submitted to random secondary screening should be greater than \nduring normal operation under a lower threat level); \n \nb) \nresults of national and local risk assessments (e.g. specific flights, destinations and aircraft operators); \nand \n \nc) \nthe technical limitations of the primary method of screening (e.g. when using WTMDs as a primary \nmethod of screening, the proportion of passengers to be randomly searched should be higher than \nwhen body scanners are used as the primary method of screening). \n \n11.5.5.2 \nThe proportion of random secondary screening should be anywhere between 1 and 99 per cent. For \ninstance, for WTMDs the minimum random percentage is typically between 10 and 20 per cent. \n \n11.5.6 \nAssessing the threat posed by \npersons through behaviour detection \n \n11.5.6.1 \nIn the framework of a risk-based approach to aviation security, behaviour detection \u2013 which can include \nbehaviour assessment or awareness \u2013 can be used to identify, in a non-discriminatory fashion, persons who may pose a \nthreat to civil aviation and should therefore be subjected to further investigation, which may include additional security \nmeasures. This technique involves the recognition of behaviour characteristics including but not limited to physiological \nor gestural signs indicative of anomalous behaviour, and can be applied to the general public, passengers and persons \nother than passengers (also referred to as non-passengers or staff). \n \n11.5.6.2 \nBehaviour detection is based on the premise that people attempting to evade security measures may \ndisplay, or can be induced to display, signs of anomalous behaviour compared to the behaviours of the legitimate \ntravelling population due to fear of detection, and that these signs can be picked up by people who have been properly \ntrained. Such training should be based on scientifically validated methods and conducted under approved training \nprogrammes in order to ensure that the capability is used in an effective and non-discriminatory way. Behaviour \ndetection programmes must be used to identify individuals solely on the basis of their behaviour and never according to \ntheir nationality, ethnicity, race, gender or religion.",

Such programmes may be used to \ncomplement other security measures. While physical screening focuses on finding prohibited items, behaviour detection \nis concerned with identifying individuals with a potential intent to commit an act of unlawful interference. \n \n \nBenefits and challenges \n \n11.5.6.5 \nA review of existing behaviour detection programmes shows that choosing persons for additional security \ncontrols on the basis of anomalous behaviour can be more effective than selecting persons randomly and is more likely \nto lead to further actions such as arrests, seizures and onward referrals to authorities. \n \n11.5.6.6 \nThrough its focus on the intention of individuals instead of prohibited items carried by passengers, \nbehaviour detection potentially allows for the detection of potential threats not currently addressed by other measures in \naviation security, or threats that may be difficult to detect by physical screening methods. \n \n11.5.6.7 \nBehaviour detection is an inherently flexible tool. Behaviour detection training can be given to staff at \ndifferent points in the airport process, including landside and security checkpoints, but also can be applied across airport \nground to help mitigate the threat posed by insiders. Behaviour detection officers can be deployed at different locations \nand times, which can contribute to unpredictability and deterrence, and they can offer a flexible and rapid response to \nincidents or new threats. \n \n11.5.6.8 \nA behaviour detection programme calls for considerable resources and commitment by States and other \nentities involved, notably in the provision of specialized training and ongoing support for behaviour detection officers, as \nwell as personnel to conduct oversight activities. Before setting up such a programme, States should ensure that \nadequate resources are available to enable its successful implementation in terms of quality and quantity, for the \nduration of the programme. \n \n11.5.6.9 \nThe effective implementation of behaviour detection may require close coordination between the various \nentities and agencies involved in the application of security measures.

Some involve the use of specialized behaviour \ndetection officers, whose primary role is to undertake observation of passengers or staff and respond accordingly. Such \nofficers may be deployed overtly or covertly, and may be used to patrol throughout the airport or in specific locations.",

Behaviours of interest can potentially be induced \nand detected by covert deployment alongside canine or police patrols, or by overt deployment at unavoidable \nbottlenecks such as doors, queues, corridors and escalators. Specialized officers can also be deployed at checkpoints to \nassist with alarm resolution processes. \n \n11.5.6.11 \nIncreasingly, behaviour detection programmes are being developed for all airport staff so they can also be \ntrained in behaviour assessment and awareness techniques. Those programmes should be designed to provide different \nlevels of knowledge depending on the targeted audience. For example, front-line screening staff, who are involved in \ninteracting with passengers, should be trained accordingly, while staff involved in the resolution and escalation of \nscreening alarms, including screeners, supervisors, managers and law enforcement officers, should be trained in \nappropriate questioning techniques combined with an understanding of behavioural indicators so as to ensure that \ncorrect decisions are taken once an issue of concern has been identified. \n \n11.5.6.12 \nTypically, behaviour detection techniques employ a four-stage process as follows: \n \na) \nestablish an environmental baseline of behaviour and appearances, at the given time and location \n(see definition of environmental baseline below); \n \nb) \nobserve persons at these locations to identify those exhibiting behaviours that differ from the \nenvironmental baseline established (referred to as \u201canomalous behaviours\u201d); \n \nc) \nresolve those anomalous behaviours through a structured, yet flexible (to prevent people with bad \nintentions from rehearsing their responses), targeted conversation (see below), potentially alongside \nadditional screening; and \n \nd) \nif anomalous behaviours cannot be satisfactorily resolved, refer those persons to appropriate \nauthorities such as local law enforcement. \n \n \nBehaviour awareness \n \n11.5.6.13 \nBehaviour awareness training, based on the same principles of behaviour detection, can also usefully be \nextended to a much wider range of staff, and potentially to everyone working in the airport environment, for example as \npart of general security awareness training. Giving staff an understanding of the basic concepts of anomalous behaviour, \nas well as both an understanding of how to report it and the responsibility or empowerment to do so, can help to provide \n\u201ceyes and ears\u201d coverage for anomalous behaviour throughout the airport. This can complement the training of a cadre \nof specialist officers with higher levels of behaviour detection skills, whose coverage will inevitably need to be focused \non a limited number of locations. \n \n \nEnvironmental baseline \n \n11.5.6.14 \nEnvironmental baseline, also referred to as \u201cbaselining\u201d, is defined as identifying expected behaviours \nwhich are commonly displayed by persons in a specific area, and behaviours exhibited during questioning when a \nperson is not subject to a stressor. This could involve people\u2019s movement, gestures, attire, mood and belongings (or lack \nthereof).",

These may be \u201cabove\u201d or \u201cbelow\u201d the environmental baseline, and may \ninclude patterns of movement and group dynamics as well as individual actions or gestures. The baseline may change \ndue to circumstances, for instance, queues, delays, flight cancellations, and increased security measures, and \nrequirements may generate an increase in the general level of stress, which will need to be factored in to the baseline. \n \n \nQuestioning techniques \n \n11.5.6.16 \nWhen a person exhibits anomalous behaviour signs, or where behaviour detection is being used as part of \nan alarm resolution process, officers should engage the individual in a polite but probing conversation intended to find a \nsatisfactory explanation for the anomalous behaviour or to assist in the alarm being resolved. They should ask questions \naimed at determining the veracity and consistency of the explanation given by the individual. This may be done in \nconjunction with additional screening measures, and the individual can also be questioned about any particular items \nthat may have caused concern. \n \n11.5.6.17 \nOfficers should be trained to conduct structured, but flexible, conversations designed to get beyond any \npre-prepared story. This should again involve establishing the individual\u2019s baseline behaviour through initial open and \nnon-challenging questions, and then increasing the cognitive load on the interviewee through more detailed probing \nquestions and, where appropriate, requests for evidence. When a person is being deceptive, this may produce answers \nthat reveal inconsistencies or gaps in their story, which should always be explored further. It may also elicit physical or \nverbal indicators that can be picked up by a trained officer. \n \n11.5.6.18 \nOfficers need to be aware of factors that can affect a successful resolution conversation, such as language, \nreligious or cultural differences, mental health issues or hidden disabilities, underlining the importance of the baselining \nphase of the conversation. There may also be reasons unconnected with aviation security why a person is displaying \nanomalous behaviours or being deceptive, whether it is because they are engaged in other criminal activities or not. \n \n11.5.6.19 \nNonetheless, any such behaviours that cannot be satisfactorily explained must be followed through and if \nthe resolution conversation cannot be concluded satisfactorily, the person should not be allowed to enter the secure \narea, and the issue should be escalated in accordance with local procedures. \n \n \nSkills, training and certification \n \n11.5.6.20 \nThe establishment of a national behaviour detection programme should be based on an appropriate, \nscientifically valid methodology that is defined, endorsed or recognized by the appropriate authority. Officers involved in \nsuch a programme should be required to possess specific skills and competencies determined by the appropriate \nauthority, in accordance with the methodology, and candidates/trainees should be assessed against those requirements. \n \n11.5.6.21 \nAlthough prior work experience in aviation is not essential, it is desirable for officers to be familiar with the \naviation environment prior to active deployment. Particular attention should be given to a candidate\u2019s interpersonal skills, \nsince the ability to engage strangers in friendly, but targeted conversations in order to elicit information, is a key \nrequirement. Given the sensitivity of some elements of the subject matter, consideration should also be given to the level \nof security clearance to be held by specialized behaviour detection officers. \n \n11.5.6.22 \nTo be effective, such staff should be trained and competent in identifying, evaluating and responding to \nanomalous behaviours, as well as baselining and questioning techniques.

The interest in \nthis type of equipment has been raised due to incidents where adversaries tried to conceal non-metallic items on their \nbody. The most infamous case is the so-called \u201cunderwear bomber\u201d who intended to use a non-metallic IED concealed \nin his underwear to attack an aircraft in mid-flight in December 2009 (Northwest flight 253). \n \n11.5.8.2 \nBody scanners are designed to provide mitigation against a broad spectrum of potential aviation threats. \nUnlike walk-through metal detectors, body scanners do not only detect metal objects, but any object on the body. They \nare therefore also referred to as \u2018anomaly\u2019 scanners since the current generation of scanners do not identify the actual \nthreats, but indicate and localize irregularities on the body. \n \n \nTechnology \n11.5.8.3 \nThe most common technology used in body scanners is \u201cmillimetre wave\u201d. The millimetre-wave technology \nemits millimetre wave radio frequencies over the body\u2019s surface, which is non-ionising, and therefore more widely \naccepted and deployed at most airport operators using body scanners. \n \n11.5.8.4 \nBackscatter X-ray technology may still be in use. This kind of technology uses a very low level of ionising \nradiation to create an image of the person. Since this technology uses ionising radiation it is prohibited in some countries \ndue to associated health concerns. \n \n11.5.8.5 \nStates should consult national health and safety authorities before deploying body scanners to ensure that \nthe body scanner meets any national health and safety requirements. It is also recommended to check with the national \nradio communications agency whether the frequencies are within a free to be used spectrum and do not interfere with \nother radio frequencies. \n \n11.5.8.6 \nBody scanners run detection algorithms to identify anomalies on persons but false alarm rates remain a \nchallenge. To address such false alarms indications, Automated Threat Recognition (ATR) software and algorithms were \ndeveloped to help improve the performance of the equipment with regard to detection and \u2018nuisance\u2019 alarm rates, and \nprogress in the field of artificial intelligence could significantly lower false alarm rates in the future. Whenever possible, \nStates should encourage research and development in that regard. A list of nationally-approved algorithms should be \ndeveloped to better assist airport operators in the acquisition of such technology. \n \n11.5.8.7 \nUnless integrated shoe screening is incorporated within the body scanner, some additional screening of \nshoes using ETD, X-ray or dedicated shoe scanners should be considered.",

Consequently, persons screened using \nbody scanners may be instructed to stand and position themselves differently according to the type of scanner.

In some cases \npassengers should stand with their hands above their head and in other cases with their arms spread next to their body. \n \n11.5.8.11 \nThe efficient use of body scanners at airports can be greatly improved when a communication strategy \ntowards passengers and staff is implemented.

An example of frequently asked questions which can be used to communicate with passengers can be found \nin Annex 8 to Appendix 20. \n \n11.5.8.13 \nWhenever possible, multiple resolution stations should be accommodated to increase throughput and \navoid bottleneck situations. Mixing of passengers that need to be further checked should be avoided. \n \n \nDivesture \n \n11.5.8.14 \nPersons undergoing body scanner screening should divest themselves of every item they carry since the \nalarm on body scanners may be triggered on multiple items left in pockets such as passports and boarding cards. To \nprevent such nuisance alarms, a clear divesting process should be implemented. These alarms can be resolved with a \ntargeted/local manual search and there may not be a requirement for random alarms to counter the lack of detection \ncapabilities as it is required with the walk-through metal detectors. States should be encouraged to require all airports \noperators to have clear signage and instructions at each screening checkpoint. These instructions should properly \nadvise persons undergoing body scanning screening of proper divesture of items in advanced of being screened. \n \n11.5.8.15 \nIn order to reduce false or nuisance alarms, it is recommended that the following items be divested, in \naccordance with the CONOPS: \n \na) \nall objects from pockets; \n \nb) \nbulky items (e.g. hats, coats, jackets, oversized sweaters); and \n \nc) \nlarge or ornate belts or belts with large buckles. \n \n11.5.8.16 \nIf the head/hair of the person undergoing body scanner screening is covered for religious or health reasons, \nthe head/hair should be subjected to additional security screening in accordance with standard operation procedures \nand the applicable ASP and/or NCASP requirements. \n \n11.5.8.17 \nAlternative security screening measures should be used when persons are deemed not suitable for body \nscanner screening. This may include persons who: \n \na) \nwear casts, prosthesis, orthosis, or other external medical devices (e.g. insulin injectors); \n \nb) \nare covered in heavy perspiration or wearing wet clothing that cannot be taken off; \n \nc) \nwear unusual clothing items such as: sparkling shirts (made of metallic material); beaded clothing \nitems, large zippers located in unusual locations; \n \nd) \nare in wheel chairs and/or cannot maintain the required stance unaided for a minimum of 3 seconds;",

This facilitates alarm resolution since \nthe person can see what has alarmed the scanner, which is especially helpful where there may be language barriers \nbetween the person and the screener. The clear graphical representation also ensures a quick, targeted and accurate \nresolution of alarms. \n \n11.5.8.20 \nWhen an alarm is produced by a body scanner, bounding boxes or spots on an avatar are displayed on a \nscreen as shown on Figure 11-6, which indicate the presence of an anomaly a screener must resolve. A body scanner \nmay indicate several bounding boxes on different parts of the body. \n \n \nFigure 11-6.  Sample body scanner displays \n \n11.5.8.21 \nFor alarm resolution purposes, body scanner screeners may need to identify whether the person being \nscreened is physically male or female.

The benefit of such an approach to screening of \npersons is that it requires less body scanners and an acceptable throughput may be maintained. It should however be \nnoted that the secondary security check may reveal items which have not been flagged during primary security \nscreening with the walk-through metal detector, since the body scanner has broader threat detection capability. \n \n11.5.8.24 \nFigure 11-7 illustrates the use of body scanners to screen persons whether as a primary or secondary \nmeans of screening. \n \n \nDeployment and maintenance \n \n11.5.8.25 \nSince body scanners, which are currently available on the market, have a larger footprint than walk- \nthrough metal detectors, the size and the weight of the equipment should be carefully considered when deploying them \nwithin an existing security checkpoint. Airport operators should also consider maintenance clearance requirements to \nprovide technicians access for servicing and maintenance. \n \n11.5.8.26 \nBody scanner screeners should perform in-line monitoring and run diagnostics of their equipment. \nDiagnostics can be useful for maintenance, but also to analyse throughput in an effort to optimize passenger flows. \n \n11.5.8.27 \nMaintenance and calibration checks should be performed periodically by trained staff in accordance with \nthe manufacturer\u2019s requirements.

In \nthis respect, States, airports and aircraft operators may need to consider the issue of liability; and \n \nf) \npassengers should be asked to place any borderline cabin baggage into the baggage template to \nconfirm that its size is acceptable, and any baggage that does not fit should then be placed in the \naircraft hold. Passengers may have the option of removing items and either discarding them, placing \nthem in hold baggage or arranging for their shipment to the destination. \n \n11.6.4.23 \nWhen new requirements are introduced, the increase in the amount of hold baggage is usually not large. \nHowever, airports and aircraft operators should consider maximizing the use of all available screening facilities to meet \npotential problems, and airports should evaluate whether extra hold baggage screening equipment and alternate hold \nbaggage screening procedures may be required. Passengers may dispute how the measures are applied, perhaps \ncausing consequential delays for other passengers. For example, a passenger may question the need to place liquid \nmedicine, stored in an unacceptable container or exceeding the quantity allowed, into the aircraft hold, expressing \nconcern about a possible negative outcome as, for instance, insulin may freeze if placed in an aircraft hold; or a \npassenger may attempt to check in with oversized cabin baggage or might object to transferring an item to the hold \nbecause of concern about its fragility or high value.",

Hold baggage should be accepted only from bona fide passengers holding a valid aircraft \noperator ticket and valid travel document, and the check-in process should be carried out by a responsible agent or \nauthorized representative of the aircraft operator. \n \n11.7.1.2 \nAll hold baggage to be carried on a commercial aircraft should be protected from unauthorized interference \nfrom the point it is screened or accepted into care of the aircraft operator, whichever is earlier, until departure of the \naircraft on which it is carried. If the integrity of hold baggage is jeopardized, the hold baggage should be rescreened \nbefore being placed on board the aircraft. \n \n11.7.1.3 \nThe security process for hold baggage is intended to ensure that baggage placed in the aircraft hold \nbelongs to bona fide passengers and has been authorized for carriage after being subjected to the necessary security \ncontrols. \n \n11.7.1.4 \nThe screening of hold baggage should apply to all international air transport operations and, to the extent \npractical, to all domestic operations based on the results of a risk assessment carried out by the relevant national \nauthority. \n \n11.7.1.5 \nArrangements for hold baggage screening should ensure minimum disruption to the normal check-in \nprocess, the boarding of passengers, and the processing and loading of the baggage. Such screening may be carried \nout before, during or after check-in. The procedures should also take into account the requirement for passengers to be \npresent during manual searches of baggage. More information on planning a hold baggage screening system and \nfacilities can be found in Appendix 19. \n \n11.7.1.6 \nAircraft operators should ensure that when they accept hold baggage from a passenger, this same \nbaggage is offloaded from the aircraft if the passenger fails to board the flight. \n \n11.7.1.7 \nHold baggage of any passenger who is denied boarding for any reason should be offloaded prior to \ndeparture. \n \n11.7.1.8 \nHold baggage that does not accompany a passenger because of mishandling or operational delays should \nnot be transported unless it has undergone appropriate security controls.",

More information on air cargo security \nmeasures and on in-flight supplies can be found in Chapter 13 and Chapter 14, respectively. \n \n \n11.7.2 \nPerson and baggage reconciliation \n \n11.7.2.1 \nAircraft operators should be required by the appropriate authority to ensure that hold baggage transported \non an aircraft belongs to bona fide passengers or crew members. This measure is often referred to as person and \nbaggage reconciliation, passenger and baggage reconciliation, passenger and baggage matching or passenger and \nbaggage association. \n \n11.7.2.2 \nPerson and baggage reconciliation should be performed in addition to other security measures, such as \nscreening, aimed at ensuring that hold baggage does not contain any explosives or explosive devices. \n \n11.7.2.3 \nPerson and baggage reconciliation is a procedure that uses a verifiable tracking system to bring attention \nto hold baggage that has been loaded or is about to be loaded on a specific flight despite the passenger\u2019s failure to \nboard the aircraft concerned. The benefit of this procedure is to positively identify hold baggage that is not properly \nmatched with a passenger or crew member on the specific flight, and to positively identify any passenger who has not \nboarded the aircraft as well as his or her associated hold baggage. \n \n11.7.2.4 \nGenerally, hold baggage should not be placed on board an aircraft unless: \n \na) \nthe hold baggage is properly marked externally to permit reconciliation with the relevant passenger or \ncrew member; \n \nb) \nthe passenger or crew member to whom the baggage belongs has checked in for the flight on which it \nis to be carried; \n \nc) \nprior to loading, the hold baggage is held in an area of the airport to which only authorized persons \nhave access; and \n \nd) \nthe hold baggage has been identified as either accompanied or unaccompanied. \n \n11.7.2.5 \nTo be effective, person and baggage reconciliation procedures should be specific to the category of person, \nas follows: \n \na) \noriginating passengers. Special attention should be paid to standby travellers and other last-minute \nseat assignments, off-airport check in and individuals who check-in as part of a group but may fail to \nboard the aircraft. When passengers travelling together are allowed to share the total baggage \nallowance, each member of the group should check his or her baggage individually and be given \nindividual baggage claim checks. Situations involving voluntary or involuntary disembarking prior to \naircraft pushback should also be considered to ensure proper and complete passenger and baggage \nreconciliation;",

The hold baggage of a transfer passenger should not be loaded \nunless the passenger has checked in, where required, and boarded the onward flight, and the \nbaggage has been reconciled by the onward aircraft operator. During situations involving increased \nthreat levels, it may be necessary for passengers to physically identify baggage before it is \ntransported. Procedures to reconcile the baggage of passengers should be defined, especially at hub \nstations, to ensure the minimum of interference with, or delay to, the activities of the airport and the \noperators; \n \nc) \ndisembarking transit passengers.

If crew members check in hold baggage at an airport check-in counter, procedures similar to \nthose for originating passengers should apply. \n \n11.7.2.6 \nThe process of person and baggage reconciliation may be accomplished physically, by using a simple \nmanual or semi-automated system, or by using a sophisticated automated electronic system that provides fast \nthroughput. Airports with high volumes of passenger traffic are advised to employ an automated system. Whichever \nmethod is used, there should be a system of verification, monitoring and inspection to ensure that correct reconciliation \nis performed. All necessary procedures should be completed before aircraft doors are closed. Security and other \ncontrols should be in place so that passengers cannot disembark undetected after boarding and prior to aircraft \npushback. \n \n11.7.2.7 \nTo facilitate effective person and baggage reconciliation, aircraft operators should implement, in addition to \nbaggage reconciliation procedures, appropriate security measures for manual and automated baggage tag stocks, in \norder to prevent any unauthorized use of baggage tags. This may be achieved by instituting proper stock control and \nauditing procedures. \n \n11.7.2.8 \nIf any doubt arises regarding the potential misuse of baggage tags, or if the integrity of stock is \ncompromised, the aircraft operator should proceed to retrieve all baggage tags from the suspected compromised stock, \nwhich should be removed from storage and destroyed, in order to prevent their unauthorized introduction into the \nbaggage system or onto an aircraft. \n \n \nPhysical person and baggage reconciliation \n \n11.7.2.9 \nIn reconciling baggage using a physical system, all originating and transfer baggage should be personally \nconfirmed by the passengers and/or crew members. The baggage should be conveyed to the side of the aircraft, and \nduring the boarding process, each person should be required to identify his or her baggage by pointing it out. Loading \nattendants may proceed with aircraft loading after each passenger produces the correct baggage claim tags as proof of \nownership. \n \n11.7.2.10 \nGate baggage may be taken from passengers at the boarding gate or alongside aircraft. Such baggage \nshould be tagged, and tag numbers recorded on the passenger and baggage manifest, or another specific document for \nmatching gate baggage tag numbers with the associated passenger. This basic reconciliation process is time-consuming \nand not widely practised, but it is effective and suitable for smaller aircraft with a low volume of baggage.",

The system matches all loaded baggage with the passengers and, in addition, tracks baggage \nlocation within the airport, at the gate and on the aircraft. \n \n11.7.2.15 \nAn automated baggage reconciliation system is typically designed to: \n \na) \ndetermine whether a piece of baggage can be positively matched to a verified, boarded passenger \nbefore it is loaded onto a departing aircraft; \n \nb) \nidentify baggage that has to be offloaded because the passenger to whom it belongs failed to board \nthe flight; and \n \nc) \nproduce flight reconciliation and flight manifest reports to highlight mismatches. \n \n11.7.2.16 \nA key component of an automated person and baggage reconciliation system is the capability to ensure \nthat each person who checks in a bag is the same person who boards the aircraft, and not someone who has taken the \noriginal passenger\u2019s place.

Such \narrangements should be based on bilateral agreements, an MoU or one-stop security agreements. \n \nNote.\u2014 More information on recognition of equivalence of security measures and one-stop security \nagreements can be found in [11.10]. More information on bilateral agreements and MoUs can be found in Chapter 4. \n \n11.8.1.2 \nEach airport differs in design and traffic characteristics. Consequently, the screening method applied \nshould be a system that is appropriate to local conditions. Each airport should consider the impact of cost, capacity and \nlocal operating conditions when determining the ideal location for screening checkpoints and the selection of screening \nmethods and technologies. More information on the location of screening checkpoints and on screening methods and \ntechnologies can be found in Appendix 16 and Appendix 20, respectively. \n \n11.8.1.3 \nThe screening of hold baggage may be carried out by manual searches, X-ray equipment or other \ndetectors of explosives and dangerous substances, or by a combination of manual procedures and equipment. In the \ninterest of facilitation, the amount of baggage to be manually searched may be minimized by using contemporary \nscreening equipment in conjunction with appropriate procedures conducted by well-trained and skilled personnel. \n \n11.8.1.4 \nAll baggage should be screened or searched by means that are acceptable to the relevant regulatory body. \nIt is recommended that security staff adopt a principle by which all baggage retains an uncleared status until positively \ncleared, that is, each item of baggage to be examined is treated as uncleared unless it can be determined that the \nbaggage and its contents do not include prohibited items. If baggage screened by X-ray has not been cleared, it should \nbe further examined in an attempt to resolve the cause of concern. Baggage should not be allowed to proceed for \ncarriage until such concerns are resolved fully and effectively. If the status of an item of baggage remains ambiguous, \nthe baggage should be treated as uncleared and subjected to further appropriate screening procedures. X-ray operators \nshould reject or subject to further screening any baggage about which they have any reservation or doubt. \n \n \n11.8.2 \nManual searches \n \n11.8.2.1 \nManual searches of hold baggage, which involve the visual and physical examination of baggage and its \ncontents, are resource intensive and generally considered suitable only for low-volume locations. At high-volume \nfacilities, this method should only be used to supplement a technical means of inspection. The process requires \nsignificant numbers of well-trained and motivated staff, as well as dedicated areas for the search process. \n \n11.8.2.2 \nPassengers and their baggage should be segregated from non-travellers during the process, and cleared \nbaggage kept under surveillance by security personnel and protected against unauthorized interference, until the \ndeparture of the aircraft on which it is carried. \n \n11.8.2.3 \nManual searches of hold baggage should be conducted following the same instructions as for cabin \nbaggage, as described in this chapter. However, on completion of a search, the baggage should be closed and fastened \nbut should not under normal circumstances be returned to the passenger. \n \n11.8.2.4 \nWhenever possible, manual searchers should have ready access to X-ray facilities and ETD equipment to \nsupport their examination of individual items. The search should be carried out at a location specified in approved \nstandard operating procedures. Preferably, the search should be conducted at a location not observable by other \npassengers, and in a secure and controlled environment.",

Further information on the use of ETD equipment can be found in [11.5.15]. \n \n \n11.8.4 \nExplosive detection dogs \n \n11.8.4.1 \nSpecially trained and certified dogs, supported by a robust quality assurance programme, are another \nmethod of detecting explosives. EDDs can be trained to detect a wide range of explosive vapours at low concentrations. \nCertified EDDs can be trained to detect new explosive scents within a few days. Trained EDDs can screen/search \npeople, baggage, cargo and facilities for the presence of explosive materials, and unlike other methods of screening, \nshould require little human interaction. Each EDD requires a dedicated handler. Depending on the working environment \nEDDs require regular rest periods, but if a handler has been certified to handle more than one dog, as one EDD is \nresting another can be deployed. To maintain the high standards required of an EDD it is essential that an appropriate \nquality assurance programme is established, with oversight by the appropriate authority, requiring EDDs to have regular \nrepetitive training involving exposure to real samples of the threats that may be encountered. If this is not properly \nmanaged, the operational capability of the teams may rapidly decline. \n \n11.8.4.2 \nIf trained correctly, EDDs can offer a quick and effective screening option for cargo and mail. EDDs can be \nused in both low-volume facilities and as a support to fast parcel screening. They may also be useful in searching \nvehicles, facilities such as passenger terminals, maintenance hangars or cargo warehouses, people, and in some cases \nsupplementing existing wider aviation screening methods during periods of increased threat. As well as their detection \nabilities, EDDs also provide a visible deterrent effect and should be considered as part of routine security control. \n \n \n11.8.5 \nConventional X-ray equipment and systems \nand additional inspection \n \n11.8.5.1 \nConventional X-ray technology is commonly used at many airports for the screening of passenger cabin \nbaggage. A number of airports use larger equipment for screening hold baggage. For the technology to be effective, a \nminimum of 10 per cent of all screened hold baggage should undergo further inspections. This rate should be \ncontinuous during both peak and off-peak periods, and should include those items that have been rejected by an X-ray \noperator, provided that the State permits the inclusion of rejected items in random manual searches. The additional \ninspection of rejected baggage, plus items selected at random by the X-ray operator, requires the provision of a \ndedicated search area. \n \n11.8.5.2 \nThe additional inspection of hold baggage should involve either a manual search or the use of: \n \na) \nEDS or advanced technology equipment; \n \nb) \nconventional X-ray equipment, with each baggage viewed from two different angles by the same \noperator at the same screening checkpoint; or \n \nc) \nconventional X-ray equipment fitted with TIP software. \n \n11.8.5.3 \nThe selection of hold baggage for further inspection should be done consistently and according to the \nprinciple of reasoned selection, as described in this chapter. Guided by X-ray images, the focus should be on baggage \nmost likely to conceal a restricted or potentially dangerous item.",

Manual searches of hold baggage at the check-in area \naddress this problem, but the process typically requires up to 20 per cent of the check-in floor space, thus limiting \nterminal check-in capacity. \n \n11.8.5.5 \nConventional X-ray systems have no capability for automatically detecting threats and detection \nperformance depends entirely on the skill and alertness of operators. If such systems are installed in front of check-in \nareas, there is usually not enough space for multi-level systems. In such cases, additional staff should be deployed, \nsince the use of conventional systems generates significantly higher numbers of manual searches than more \nsophisticated technology. \n \n \nDuration of duty time for X-ray equipment operators \n \n11.8.5.6 \nThe question of how long an operator can perform hold baggage X-ray assessment without needing a rest \nbreak depends on factors such as the: \n \na) \ntime of day and shift; \n \nb) \nlevel of cumulative sleep loss; \n \nc) \neffect of previous work shifts; \n \nd) \ntype of task to be performed; and \n \ne) \nworkload. \n \n11.8.5.7 \nX-ray image interpretation is a complex task that can be mentally demanding. In one study, it was \nobserved that security staff rejected more items during their first 15 minutes of monitoring than in subsequent 15-minute \nintervals. Given the above factors, it is important for X-ray operators to have regular breaks. \n \n11.8.5.8 \nScreeners should not interpret X-ray images continuously for periods exceeding 45 minutes. The optimal \nwork interval is 25 minutes. Rest periods of at least 15 minutes should be interspersed with work periods in which the \nscreener is continuously engaged in interpreting X-ray imagery. \n \n \n11.8.6 \nComputer-assisted X-ray equipment and systems \n \n11.8.6.1 \nComputer-assisted X-ray systems automatically identify potential threats and suspicious dense areas \nwithin baggage based on X-ray information. The system can produce an image that draws an operator\u2019s attention to an \nobject or area that warrants closer examination and assessment. \n \n11.8.6.2 \nThe combined use of new technologies, such as advanced technology X-ray and explosive detection \nsystems that feature computed tomography technology, offers a significantly higher level of confidence than can be \nachieved with the use of conventional X-ray systems. The need for manual searches is dramatically reduced, with the \nresult that far fewer passengers need to be reunited with their baggage if searches become necessary downstream of \nthe check-in area.",

In airports \nwhere space is at a premium, the use of combined technologies is advantageous because it minimizes the demand for \nadditional terminal space. Such technologies may also be installed in the baggage handling system downstream of the \ncheck-in area. \n \n11.8.7 \nBaggage handling system and combined technologies \n \n11.8.7.1 \nHold baggage screening may be conducted while baggage is in the baggage handling system, using a \ncombination of automated technologies and image or data analysis by human operators. Technologies currently used in \nthis process include high-capacity advanced technology automated X-ray systems and certified EDS equipment. With \nthis process, moreover, new technologies can be incorporated as they are proven effective and brought onto the market. \n \n11.8.7.2 \nThe most commonly used systems worldwide follow a generic model based on a total of five levels of \nscreening, with the first two levels integrated into the operation of the baggage handling system. All baggage whose \nstatus remains uncertain after screening at a particular level is referred to the next level of screening. Levels 1, 2 and 3 \nof the comprehensive baggage screening system require the use of various types of specialized screening equipment. \n \n11.8.7.3 \nThe generic five-level model is described below: \n \na) \nLevel 1. Screening is carried out by high-speed X-ray equipment with automated explosive detection \ncapabilities. Images of baggage that cannot be cleared are reviewed by an operator at a remote \nworkstation. \n \nb) \nLevel 2. A group of workstations, each equipped with image enhancement and manipulation features, \npermit diagnosis of the images. An operator decides whether the baggage is acceptable. If not, \nbaggage is referred to Level 3, including those: \n \n1) that cannot be allocated a unique security identity by the baggage handling system, regardless of \nthe operator\u2019s decision; \n \n2) for which the operator cannot make a decision within a defined period of time, known as timed-out \nbaggage; and \n3) that are positively rejected by the operator. \n \nc) \nLevel 3. All baggage that is either uncleared by the Level 2 operator or subject to errors in the tracking \nsystem is diverted to Level 3 screening. Level 3 equipment typically consists of certified computed \ntomography EDS units. This screening process is often conducted offline from the main conveyor \nsystem to avoid delays to cleared baggage. Any baggage uncleared at Level 3 is referred to further \nlevels of screening that are also not associated with the baggage handling system. Baggage cleared \nat Level 3 is re-routed back into the main baggage handling process for delivery to the assigned \nsorting area. \n \nd) \nLevel 4. This level normally requires that the passenger be summoned for a manual search of the \nbaggage contents. This procedure is often carried out close to the departure gate, where the \npassenger can be found quickly. However, it is preferable that the search be conducted in a more \nremote location not observable by other passengers. Baggage cleared at this point is loaded directly \nonto an aircraft. Baggage that remains uncleared, or whose owner cannot be found, is re-categorized \nas Level 5 baggage.",

Baggage viewed as suspicious by security screening staff is diverted to Level 5 screening. \nThe relevant authorities, including police, and airport management are notified by the security operator \nwhen uncleared baggage is referred to Level 5, and predetermined emergency procedures are \ninitiated, usually involving referral to a specialist explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) team. \n \n11.8.7.4 \nVariations on the generic five-level model include the following set-ups: \n \na) \nLevel 2 operator workstations are replaced by an integrated computed tomography EDS unit. At \nairports where this solution has been adopted, the peak hourly baggage throughput is reduced to \nmatch the maximum capacity of the specific computed tomography equipment, which typically \namounts to 450 to 500 bags per hour; and \n \nb) \nthe baggage handling system is modified to automatically direct pre-selected baggage to a certified \nEDS unit. This may be achieved through the software tracking system or the use of appropriate \nbaggage tags (typically radio frequency identification) attached during or prior to check-in. \n \n11.8.7.5 \nThe current maximum throughput capacity of certified EDS equipment negates its use as a primary \nscreening system for moderate and higher capacity baggage handling systems. \n \n11.8.7.6 \nIf a multi-level search process is adopted, the following general principles should be applied: \n \na) \nthe number of search levels should be kept to a minimum; \n \nb) \nrelevant information should be passed on from one level to the next; \n \nc) \neach successive search level should provide a clear additional security value by increasing the depth, \nquality and/or level of detail of the examination; and \n \nd) \nthe search process should always be fail-safe. \n \n11.8.7.7 \nThe system should automatically reject baggage when: \n \na) \nthe operator fails to make a decision; \n \nb) \nthe baggage is mistracked within the hold baggage screening system; or \n \nc) \nthe screening equipment fails to process the baggage because of insufficient information. \n \n11.8.7.8 \nWhile the specifications and performance capabilities of the screening equipment utilized in a multi-level \nhold baggage screening system will determine the rejection rates for the different screening levels of the system, the \nappropriate authority should determine and monitor the acceptable rejection rate for each level, i.e. significantly below or \nabove which would indicate a probable anomaly with detection capabilities, and prompt the appropriate authority and/or \nairport authority to take remedial action as applicable. Different acceptable rejection rates should also be determined in \nrelation to increased detection capability needs as may be required for the various national levels of threat.",

In particular, but \nnot exclusively, the operator should look for the components of an IED, including detonators, wires, \nbatteries and electronic or mechanical timing devices. Particular attention should be given to dense or \nopaque areas that might conceal prohibited items, and areas highlighted by the system as potential \nlocations for a threatening item; \n \nb) \ncheck that the shading of a baggage image is consistent throughout, since lighter edges may indicate \nthe presence of a sheet explosive that does not completely line the top or bottom of the baggage; \n \nc) \npay as much attention to the baggage framework and appendages as to its contents; and \n \nd) \nexamine any metallic or channelled part of baggage for apparent bulges or protrusions which could \npartially conceal a component of an explosive device. \n \n11.8.8.2 \nIf an X-ray operator is not fully satisfied that the baggage and its contents do not contain any prohibited \nitems or components of prohibited items, the baggage should undergo further examination. Operators should never feel \nunder pressure to clear an item of baggage. \n \n \nProcedures for handling non-standard baggage \n \n11.8.8.3 \nOversized, overweight, oddly-shaped or otherwise non-standard baggage that cannot be processed \nthrough the standard baggage system may often be subjected to X-ray screening by using equipment with a larger \ntunnel aperture. Items that cannot be screened by X-ray, however, should be searched manually. \n \n11.8.8.4 \nSome items, such as bicycles and skis, do not readily lend themselves to a conventional manual search, \nand should therefore be thoroughly examined by physical and visual means. Items that may be detached or removed \nshould, whenever possible, be screened by X-ray. It is useful to support this process with ETD equipment, focusing on \nareas where explosives may be concealed or inserted. \n \n \nSystem control and management \n \n11.8.8.5 \nOnce hold baggage screening equipment has been set up for optimum operation, control of any changes \nto the system hardware and software, including settings, should be limited to specific authorized persons.

These security controls, also called unpredictable \nmeasures, should be implemented in such a way that it is highly unlikely for the persons subject to such measures (i.e. \npassengers, non-passengers and, under certain circumstances, the general public) to predict when, where and how they \nwill be applied. \n \n11.9.1.2 \nThe application of unpredictability in aviation security can help disrupt hostile reconnaissance, surveillance, \nrehearsal and attack through the deployment of highly visible security controls at locations other than screening \ncheckpoints, and the introduction of unexpected elements to the screening of the general public, passengers and staff, \nin the overall security framework. In this regard, the implementation of unpredictable measures support an effective \nsecurity culture through heightened vigilance, layered application of and increased compliance with security measures, \nas well as an enhanced security conscious mindset for the persons subject to such measures. \n \n11.9.1.3 \nUnpredictable measures within a security regime should be implemented in a manner that is supported by \na risk assessment and documented methodology, with a view to achieving the outcome of thwarting and deterring acts \nof unlawful interference. \n \n11.9.1.4 \nA risk assessment should therefore be carried out by the relevant national authorities, identifying the types \nof, and establishing the areas concerned by, unpredictable measures. These measures should be adapted and \nimplemented by relevant local entities in the airport environment. \n \n \n11.9.2 \nObjective and benefits \n \n11.9.2.1 \nThe introduction of unpredictable measures should not hinder or weaken existing Annex 17 international \nStandards. \n \n11.9.2.2 \nUnpredictable measures may introduce a number of benefits, including but not limited to, the following: \n \na) \nenhanced deterrent effects (including insider threat); \n \nb) \nincreased detection opportunities; \n \nc) \nenhanced efficiency using existing resources, through resource management and staff motivation; and \n \nd) \nflexibility in implementation (e.g. for high-risk flights and in areas where deficiencies have been \nidentified). \n \n \nEnhanced deterrence \n \n11.9.2.3 \nThe introduction of unpredictability into security regimes may enhance protection against hostile \nreconnaissance, surveillance and rehearsal activities, during which vulnerabilities can be identified and exploited. The \nuse of unpredictable measures, especially when highly visible, can contribute to making existing security regimes less \npredictable. It therefore becomes more challenging for individuals to circumvent the measures in place and carry out an \nact of unlawful interference. \n \n11.9.2.4 \nThe unforeseeable nature of unpredictable measures may render attack planning more challenging, while \nincreasing the likelihood of disrupting such attacks. Similarly, unpredictable measures may mitigate new and existing",

For instance, the advantage of someone working at an airport possessing sufficient \nknowledge of routine security systems may be significantly reduced if unpredictable measures are in place. \n \n \nDeterrent-only unpredictable measures \n \n11.9.2.5 \nSome overt unpredictable measures may be deployed to achieve a deterrent effect only, while the general \npublic, passengers and staff are led to believe that such measures are meant for detection. Such measures are \nsometimes referred to as \u201cdecoy measures\u201d. For example, an airport may position canine teams at boarding gates \nalthough they have not been trained in the detection of explosives. \n \n11.9.2.6 \nOvert unpredictable decoy measures, which are aimed to achieve a deterrent effect only, should never be \ndeployed in lieu of baseline measures such as screening or security controls, even on a temporary basis or to \ncompensate for a lack of effectiveness of screening or security controls. Deterrent-only measures should not be used as \na means of compliance with international Standards, including Annex 17 provisions, and should only be considered in \naddition to a predictable or unpredictable security regime. \n \n \nIncreased detection \n \n11.9.2.7 \nThe application of unpredictability can further increase the detection opportunities of existing security \nregimes. For example, relevant entities may deploy explosives detection dogs or mobile explosives trace detector \nstations in various strategic locations on airport premises, e.g. before screening checkpoints, in lounge areas, at \nboarding gates, and within security restricted areas. \n \n \nEnhanced efficiency \n \n11.9.2.8 \nSecurity staff often find themselves performing repetitive tasks for a pre-determined period of time (i.e. \nshifts) during which they should remain alert, and are therefore faced with \u201croutine\u201d syndrome. While Human Factors \nprinciples help optimize the efficiency with which security staff carry out their duties, the application of unpredictable \nmeasures provides an opportunity to break the routine by deploying staff in different locations during the day, and \napplying a wider set of security controls than those applied under predictable security regimes. \n \n11.9.2.9 \nAppropriate training should be provided to security staff involved in the application of unpredictable \nmeasures. Such training should allow security staff to better understand the dynamic nature of the threats to and \nvulnerabilities of the airport environment within which they operate, and the importance they play in ensuring the security \nof the airport at all times. For example, security staff may be encouraged to propose new unpredictable measures \ncatered to the characteristics of the airport and/or certain areas in which they work. A direct benefit of such training \nshould be greater involvement by and motivation of security staff in carrying out their duties. \n \n \nFlexibility \n \n11.9.2.10 \nIn the event of an increase in threat level, whether at the national or local level, unpredictable measures \nmay be an efficient, rapid and flexible solution to counter the threat. These measures may be deployed in areas that are \nusually not considered at risk, yet for which security staff are already appropriately trained, irrespective of the location. \nThe application of unpredictability in a security regime may therefore facilitate the timely deployment of additional \nsecurity controls aimed at mitigating new threats, without requiring new and time-consuming security training.",

At the same \ntime, maintaining a high level of confidentiality regarding the times and locations of the deployment of measures is \nequally important. Relevant entities should therefore implement an adequate communication strategy aimed at informing \nthe general public, passengers and staff that additional non-discriminatory unpredictable security measures are in place \nat an airport. Airport staff should be aware of the benefits of such measures, while ensuring that only a limited number of \npersons with an operational need to know are provided with details about when and where unpredictable measures are \nto be implemented. For example, if unpredictable measures are to be implemented at a screening checkpoint, the \nsupervisor on duty should be the only person aware of the deployment schedule, and instruct the security staff \naccordingly. \n \n11.9.4.4 \nPassenger experience should be a key component when considering new security measures, and relevant \nentities should therefore develop a communication strategy designed to inform the general public of the benefits and \nimpact that the application of unpredictable measures may have on their travel experiences. Such information should \ninclude what to expect before, during and/or beyond a screening checkpoint, as well as why such measures are \nimplemented. \n \n11.9.4.5 \nThe objective of such a communication strategy is two-fold: preparing the general public, passengers and \nstaff for a new scheme of measures they may not be familiar with, and achieving the deterrent effect sought when \nintroducing unpredictability into a security regime. \n \n11.9.4.6 \nRelevant entities should, in particular, communicate the non-discriminatory nature of unpredictability and \nemphasize that every passenger and staff member has equal probability of being subjected to unpredictable security \ncontrols. \n \n11.9.4.7 \nSecurity and non-security staff should both be fully trained in the new security environment.

Some categories of airports, and the flights operating from \nthem, may be regarded as representing a higher or lower-risk to aviation security due to a range of factors. \nConsequently, States may consider assessing the security threats faced by some categories of airports and implement \ndifferent security measures that are better adapted to the risk level of those categories, while maintaining compliance \nwith Annex 17 provisions and national aviation security baselines (as laid out in the NCASP). \n \n11.11.1.2 \nSecurity regulations and measures aim to address threats and mitigate associated risks to civil aviation \nand provide assurance for the security of international operations. However, some of these measures may not be \nappropriate and proportionate for lower-risk airports whose specific, and often limited, operations are such that the risk \ncontext is lower than that of other airports. Lower-risk airports may also encounter financial, practical or resource \nchallenges in applying security measures that are primarily intended to mitigate risks associated with higher-risk airports \nand larger aircraft. Noting that some passenger journeys may begin at a lower-risk airport before connecting through a \nhigher-risk airport, and the need to avoid creating vulnerabilities in the global aviation network, it is possible nonetheless \nfor States to avoid a \u201cone size fits all\u201d approach by developing different security measures for lower-risk airports that still \ndeliver an appropriate level of security, and if necessary applying additional measures for those who transfer onto \nhigher-risk flights. \n \n \n11.11.2 \nCategorization and risk assessments \n \n11.11.2.1 \nThe categorization of airports for these purposes should be based on risk as the primary consideration. \nThe criteria for defining lower-risk airports should be clearly established within the National Civil Aviation Security \nProgramme and should be based on a careful analysis of the types of threat that may apply to operations at and from \nthat category of airport. \n \n11.11.2.2 \nTo determine what different measures to implement at which airports, States should follow a two-step \napproach by regularly conducting risk assessments that take into account a number of specific operational \ncharacteristics, with the goal of: \n \na) \nestablishing categories of airports that face common threats and have similar risks associated with \nthese threats; and \n \nb) \nidentifying, based on airport-specific risk assessments, different security measures that may be \nimplemented at such airports while ensuring compliance with international and national security \nrequirements. \n \n11.11.2.3 \nBased on those risk assessments, which should be conducted regularly to account for possible changes in \nthe threat and risk picture, the appropriate authority should clearly specify and authorize any different security measures \nto be undertaken by lower-risk airports, and oversee their effective implementation. \n \n11.11.2.4 \nDrawing on the methodology set out in the Aviation Security Global Risk Context Statement (Doc 10108 \u2013 \nRestricted) the most relevant types of threat scenarios to be considered in developing a risk-based categorization of \nairports would include:",

When activating a temporary SRA, enhanced security controls should \nensure that the area is free of prohibited items and ready for aircraft operations. Communications \nshould also be in place to ensure that all staff are aware of the existence of a temporary SRA; \n \nb) \nautomated or remote access control systems using technology to control entry by authorized persons \nand vehicles; \n \nc) \nlower cost and/or low technology screening methods, such as manual search, for passengers and/or \nbags; \n \nd) \nuse of mobile or portable screening technology: for example, screening equipment might be shared \nbetween security and customs authorities and moved between the departure and arrival areas, as \nneeded, and provided the equipment meets all aviation security regulatory requirements; \n \ne) \nremote screening of hold baggage: for example, emerging technology will allow airports (e.g. in the \nsame airport networks) to pool their screening images for review in one central location; \n \nf) \nother airports (e.g. in the same airport networks) to carry out common CCTV monitoring, \ncomplemented by local patrols in case any intervention is needed; \n \ng) \nairport security staff to perform multiple functions including non-security roles, provided they are \nproperly vetted and trained to carry out their security functions; \n \nh) \nreduced requirements for perimeter surveillance and patrolling; and",

The Convention also places an obligation \non all diplomatic personnel \u201cto respect the laws and regulations of the receiving State\u201d, including legally enforceable \npreboarding screening (Article 41). \n \n12.1.1.4 \nAdditionally, although certain passengers may have diplomatic immunity, including personal inviolability, \nthey are nevertheless subject to routine preboarding screening and/or inspections as necessary for aircraft security. \nWhile the personal property of certain persons may be inviolable, for the purpose of civil aviation security, personal \nbaggage, including cabin and hold baggage belonging to diplomats and their family members is subject to the same \nscreening requirements applied to regular baggage. \n \n12.1.1.5 \nOn those occasions when normal processing is considered inappropriate, private screening should be \nprovided on request.

Whenever possible, dedicated areas (e.g. VIP lounges, protocol terminals) should be \nused to avoid contact with the normal passenger circuits. \n \n12.1.2.5 \nThe Department of Internal Affairs, the Department of Protocol and the police should be in charge of \ndeparture and arrival formalities and the security of important persons. Planning for visits involving travel to and from a \nState should include specific security planning for the arrival and departure phases and/or domestic movements. \n \n12.1.2.6 \nIt should be appreciated that there is almost inevitably an increase in the level of risk to flights on which \nRoyalty and Heads of State are travelling. For travel on a regular scheduled service, while accompanying officials have \nan important security responsibility with respect to the official party, the increased risk to other passengers cannot be \noverlooked. Security arrangements for the official party should not be allowed to compromise the security of the flight as \na whole and that of the other passengers. \n \n12.1.2.7 \nIf travel to, from or within a State is by exclusive charter, military or private aircraft, security involvement will \nusually be limited to the security of the aircraft itself and such ground security as circumstances may require. Special \nattention should be placed on possible interferences with normal operations, the potential risk of attacks on the airport \nand/or terminal facilities and/or disruptive behaviour of protestors in the terminal facilities or on the roads leading to the \nairport. Any distracting activities that might compromise the quality of security services should not be overlooked. \n \n12.1.2.8 \nIf any sector of the journey involves travel on a scheduled passenger service, additional security will, in \nmost cases, be necessary. The degree of security will vary according to the level of threat generated by the presence of \nthe official party. Organizations, in addition to the host government department and the police that should be consulted \nin such situations are the aircraft operator, appropriate authority and airport security authority.",

The use of armed in- \nflight security officers is a potential risk that may endanger the aircraft or its occupants. In-flight security officers can \nprevent and suppress an act of unlawful interference if deployed officers are well selected, educated and trained in the \nconsequences of their intervention. Failure to have a proper selection, education and training programme for IFSOs can \nlead to serious accidents. Thus, necessary attention should be given by States to the legal, operational and tactical \nfactors governing the use of IFSOs on board civil aircraft. \n \n12.4.1.3 \nThe decision to implement an IFSO programme rests with the State, and States should thoroughly study all \nrelevant aspects prior to making the decision to establish an IFSO programme. The deployment of IFSOs should then be \nconsidered for both international and domestic flights. States are urged to conduct a rigorous threat assessment prior to \nproceeding with IFSO deployment and the term of deployment should depend on the State\u2019s judgement of its aviation \nsecurity needs and on the threat assessment. In-flight security officer programmes should be carefully planned,",

International cooperation between States and the timely \nsharing of threat data will lead to an effective aviation security effort in general and IFSO programmes in particular. \n \n12.4.1.4 \nStates that deploy IFSOs on board aircraft engaged in passenger commercial air transport operations \nshould develop national legislation, policies, procedures and specific implementing instructions with respect to such \nofficers. States should consider the views of aircraft operators in the development of an IFSO programme. \n \n12.4.1.5 \nDeployment of armed IFSOs on international routes requires the agreement of the governments of the \nState of the Operator and State of Registry of the aircraft. Agreements should also be negotiated with certain other \nStates, including those in which intermediate stops may be made and those which may serve as alternative destinations \nin the event of an emergency diversion of an aircraft with armed IFSOs. \n \n12.4.1.6 \nStates may wish to consider establishing an MoU or similar bilateral agreement, in order to clarify \nprovisions for the deployment of IFSOs. A model MoU can be found in Appendix 29. \n \n12.4.1.7 \nIt is the prerogative of States to decide how to distribute written documentation on the deployment of and \nprocedures related to IFSOs. States should, however, ensure strict confidentiality. Such information should not be \ndisclosed to entities unnecessarily, or shared with governments or airports and aircraft operators that are not a party. \n \n12.4.1.8 \nAuthorities concerned with the approval and facilitation of IFSO activities should coordinate closely with \neach other and with airports and aircraft operators. \n \n12.4.1.9 \nEach State should decide under what circumstances IFSOs may be permitted to carry weapons while in its \nterritory, if at all. In-flight security officers are considered to be an important last line of defence against an act unlawful \ninterference on board civil aircraft. As a primary principle, the use of such officers should not diminish the reliance of \nStates on the implementation of essential ground security controls as measures to prevent an act of unlawful \ninterference against civil aviation. \n \n12.4.1.10 \nStates should define employment requirements, as IFSOs should be government personnel, along with \ntraining standards and the rules of engagement, and assign legal liability in the event of an on-board incident. \n \n \n12.4.2 \nSelection \n \n12.4.2.1 \nConfidentially written and formalized procedures should be in place to select, train and qualify in-flight \nsecurity officers.

The standards for IFSOs are far higher than those for routine \npolice, military or other security personnel. \n \n12.4.2.2 \nAll applicants for IFSOs status should undergo extensive psychological and physical examinations and be \nsubject to routine re-examinations throughout their careers as IFSOs. The stress and strain of IFSO duties, combined \nwith the critical judgement that they should exercise, require that only emotionally stable and mature individuals be \nselected. Background checks on the personal record of applicants should be conducted prior to the selection process. \n \n12.4.2.3 \nCriteria should be developed by which applicants may be determined as qualified candidates and only the \nmost qualified persons should be selected.

Cargo and mail may be perceived as a \npotential medium of attack because: \n \na) \nthe environment in which the air cargo and mail industry operates is growing and is becoming \nincreasingly complex; \n \nb) \nthe capacity of the industry to respond to this growth and complexity is challenged by the presence of \nmultiple actors who handle air cargo and mail entering and exiting the supply chain; and \n \nc) \nawareness of the vulnerabilities of the air cargo supply chain is increasing, as a result of information \ndisseminated by terrorists and the media. \n \n13.1.1.3 \nPeriodic risk assessments should be carried out and security measures reviewed and, if necessary, \nadjusted to be commensurate with the risk.

A comprehensive chart describing the air cargo \nsecure supply chain process can be found in Appendix 30. It includes multiple processes that are detailed later in this \nchapter. \n \n13.3.1.3 \nStates are encouraged to follow these best practices to optimize the security outcome and minimize impact \non trade facilitation. \n \n13.3.1.4 \nThe key pillars that characterize a secure supply chain are: facility security, personnel security, training, \nscreening, protection of screened cargo, chain of custody and compliance/oversight (quality control).

EDDs can address the needs of regulators and industry for an effective and efficient air cargo screening solution \nif properly implemented. This guidance material provides the regulatory requirements for entities who wish to implement \nEDDs as a screening method for air cargo. \n \n \nIntegration with national programme \n \n13.6.1.2 \nWhen a State intends to allow the use of EDDs as a screening method for air cargo, it should incorporate \nrequirements governing how operators implement EDDs into its National Civil Aviation Security Programme (NCASP) \nand other relevant regulatory instruments, thereby establishing an EDD programme and regulatory framework under the \nState\u2019s aviation security regime. \n \n13.6.1.3 \nEDD regulatory frameworks should comprise the following elements: \n \na) \ncertification \u2013 requirements concerning how EDDs, EDD handlers and EDD teams are to be certified, \nsuch as certification standards, guidelines for persons responsible for conducting certification and \noversight of certification activities. This may also include the delegation of responsibilities to third \nparties to conduct the certification of EDD teams; in such cases, the appropriate authority must set out \nclear duties for the third parties conducting certification, and have the means to verify that the third \nparties are undertaking certification activities properly; \n \nb) \ntraining \u2013 requirements concerning the training and development of EDDs, EDD handlers and EDD \nteams, such as initial and recurrent training requirements, training curricula and oversight of the \ntraining process. This may also include requirements concerning the responsibilities of third parties \nconducting the training of EDD teams;",

The introduction of EDDs as a new method of screening for \ncargo should be undertaken with clarity for all parties involved as to which regulated entity will be responsible for \ndeclaring cargo as secure subsequent to screening under a State\u2019s national programme (i.e. whether the arrangement \nprevious to the introduction of EDDs as a screening method continues, or a new arrangement will be implemented for \nEDD screening of cargo). \n \n13.6.1.5 \nAlternatively, EDDs may be used as a secondary screening method for cargo, consistent with the \nregulatory requirements and secondary screening procedures approved by a State\u2019s appropriate authority. When used \nas a primary screening method, EDDs cannot be used for alarm resolution. \n \n13.6.1.6 \nThe development and implementation of robust quality assurance protocols within the national EDD \nprogramme is necessary in order to ensure that screening performance standards are continuously monitored and \nmaintained. These should comprise both regular routine testing during operations, and periodic recertification and/or \nhigh assurance testing using realistic target materials, concealments and cargo environments. The outcome of testing \nshould be continuously monitored by the appropriate authority, who should have a process in place to quickly identify \nand deal with any underperforming EDD. \n \n13.6.2 \nMethods of deploying EDDs for air cargo screening \n \n13.6.2.1 \nThere are two main methods of deploying EDDs for air cargo screening: \n \na) \nfree running \u2013 the handler tasks the EDD, either on- or off-lead, to search cargo; upon detection of \nexplosive material, the dog would alert its handler on the specific area where the explosive odour is \nrecognized. Based on training experience, the handler will recognize the EDD\u2019s behaviour when it \ndetects the presence of explosives. The handler may wish to direct the EDD to search again a specific \nconsignment/portion of the cargo to confirm the exact location of the explosive material; and \n \nb) \nremote explosive scent tracing \u2013 an air sample from the cargo is captured, and presented \nretrospectively to a suitably trained and certified EDD that will indicate positively if the air sample \ncontains the scent of a trained explosive odour. \n \n13.6.2.2 \nEach method carries its own specific set of operational considerations that the appropriate authority should \nincorporate into requirements on the use of EDD screening of cargo. Whichever method is selected for a State\u2019s regime, \nEDD teams undertaking air cargo screening should not be deployed for other types of operations (e.g. narcotics and \ncontraband detection), or undertake screening for customs or safety needs, at the same time.",
  "350": "13-30 \nAviation Security Manual \nSensitive Security Information \nDissemination, reproduction or onward distribution of this document is expressly prohibited without the consent of the originators. \n \n \n \n \nFree running dogs (FREDDs) \n \n13.6.2.3 \nApplication of FREDDs requires that the team conduct a search for explosives where the cargo is stored or \nprepared (e.g. a cargo warehouse and an airfreight terminal). The dog should be trained to indicate positively where in \nthe cargo consignment it detects the scent of an explosive odour it was trained to recognize. The indication needs to be \nas accurate as possible in order to determine which consignment(s) should go for secondary screening. \n \n13.6.2.4 \nThe manner in which cargo is presented to the EDD team and the screening environment where the EDD \nteam is operating in should not impair the performance of the team. To that end, the appropriate authority should assess \nwhether FREDDs can be suitably applied for cargo screening before approving the conduct of FREDD operations. A re- \nassessment by the entity conducting EDD screening should be undertaken whenever there are changes in the way \ncargo is presented, or the screening environment, have taken place. \n \n13.6.2.5 \nThe following is a list of factors that authorities should consider when assessing whether the application of \nFREDD is suitable: \n \na) \ncargo placement \u2013 authorities should determine the maximum limit within which EDDs may conduct \nscreening on a part of a shipment 4 , particularly where larger shipments are concerned. Where \noperators are able to address safety concerns, States may consider allowing EDDs to operate on an \nelevated platform in order for the EDD to reach areas of cargo higher than the determined maximum \nlimits; alternatively, the EDD team can screen the cargo prior to packing the cargo at a height greater \nthan the maximum limit; \n \nb) \nsize of consignments \u2013 cargo consignments come in different configurations, such as in homogenized \nconsolidated shipments, loose cargo at piece level, built-up pallets and unit load devices (ULDs). For \nlarger consignments, the EDD team may need to carry out a series of searches, each covering a \ndifferent part of the consignment to ensure that screening is thorough and covers all sections of the \ncargo, including the centre. The appropriate authority should set out the maximum area 5 each search \ncan cover to ensure EDD teams conduct screening thoroughly, or the maximum height or width of a \nconsignment cargo which can be subjected to EDD screening; and \n \nc) \nsoak time \u2013 the longer an explosive substance dwells in an environment, the larger the developing \nodour pool will be, thus enhancing detection. Different explosives have different vapour pressures, and \ndependent on explosive quantity, the size and type of container, the time required for explosive \nvapours to become effectively detectable by EDDs, or \u2018soak time\u2019, may differ. The appropriate \nauthority should consider such factors, and determine the minimum soak time for cargo, beginning \nwith the packaging/consolidation of the cargo, before an EDD can screen the cargo. The appropriate \nauthority should consider incorporating soak time into current cargo operations in order to ensure both \neffective screening and smooth movement of cargo. For example, the soak time could include the time \ntaken to transport the cargo to the location of screening, if the cargo was packed and consolidated at \nanother location; \n \n \n4  Examples of how different authorities have set out the maximum limit include the following categories (authorities are free to \ndetermine the limits applied under their respective EDD regimes based on their local circumstances): height based limits; distance \nfrom dog\u2019s nose; and radius. \n5  Examples of how different authorities have set out maximum search areas include the following categories (authorities are free to \ndetermine the limits applied under their respective EDD regimes based on their local circumstances): a length X breadth X depth \nsection of cargo; and setting a maximum length of a search section to the length of a standard pallet.",

Should there be no safety issues6 (e.g. leaking of \ncontents such as powders and liquids), and the appropriate authority does not have a concern \nwith the soak time applicable to the said package, EDD screening directed to the package could \nbe conducted, and re-wrapped after the search is completed; and \n \n2) \nsome types of packaging (e.g. plastic sealed/wrapped merchandise, 5-gallon buckets, pelican \ncases, welded barrels) could seal target odours within packaging and deter EDD screening. In \nsuch instances, unless the appropriate authority and the cargo handling entity have agreed that, \nas part of the EDD screening procedure, the EDD team is allowed to make adjustments to the \npackaging (e.g. puncturing outer plastic shrink wrap) in order to allow the canine to access target \nodours, such cargo should be screened using other methods. When making adjustments to \npackaging, care should be taken to not damage cargo. Otherwise, a different method of screening \nshould be applied; and \n \ne) \nscreening environment \u2013 \n \n1) \ntemperature: temperatures should be considered in the use of EDDs for screening of cargo as it \nmay affect the availability of explosives vapours. It is important that the EDD is appropriately \nacclimatized to the environment; \n \n2) \nhumidity: if the air is extremely dry, this will reduce the transportation of target molecules in the \nair, making scent detection more difficult; humid conditions comparatively will have the opposite \neffect in keeping scent down, and typically improve detection; \n \n3) \nwind speed and direction: strong winds may reduce the ability for the dog to indicate accurately. \nIndoor conditions may reduce the negative impact wind speeds and directions; and \n \n4) \ndistractions: dogs may be distracted by the presence of loud noises, bright lights, new \nsurroundings, food, other animals, and persons uninvolved with air cargo operations. As far as \npossible, distractions should be minimized to ensure the effectiveness of the EDD team\u2019s \noperation. Persons, moving vehicles, and other objects not relevant to the screening operations \npresent at the screening area should be kept to a minimum. \n \n13.6.2.6 \nEDD teams deployed for cargo screening should undergo sufficient training in a realistic environment that \nacclimates the dog and its handler to the above operational factors. This ensures that the EDD team can operate \neffectively in the cargo environment without being distracted or negatively impacted during the screening process. In \naddition, maintaining the control of the EDD is integral to the safety of the EDD and others around the facility. \n \n13.6.2.7 \nDuring screening, the handler should search all areas of the shipment and its packaging thoroughly, before \nmoving on to the next consignment for screening. \n \n \n \n6 \nAdditionally, in the case of dangerous goods, authorities should also consider the possibility that an EDD may suffer from the \ninhalation of fumes from dangerous goods, and require such goods to be screened with a different method.",

Samples of air from cargo pallets, boxes or containers are first \ncollected using a filter designed to capture air particles. Thereafter, an EDD team analyses the air samples for explosive \nvapours. \n \n13.6.2.9 \nThe appropriate authority should set out requirements applicable to a REST operation concerning the type \nof equipment used in its operations, as the calibration and proper maintenance of equipment is essential to ensure the \neffectiveness of the screening method. Such requirements may cover the areas of vacuum pressure of equipment, the \npresentation of the sample to the EDD, and quality control activities. \n \nSampling \n \n13.6.2.10 \nREST requires operators to acquire air samples of sufficient quality. Filter equipment used for acquiring air \nsamples should strike a balance between being able to absorb sufficient molecules during the taking of the air sample, \nas well as desorb sufficient molecules when the sample is presented to the EDD for analysis (instead of prior to \npresentation for analysis). \n \n13.6.2.11 \nThe packaging of air cargo and mail may impede the sampling of air molecules from the contents of the \ncargo. For example, airtight packaging may be used to prevent water from seeping into the contents of the cargo. In \nsuch situations, it may be difficult for the REST method to be applied reliably unless the packaging of cargo can be \npenetrated to assist in the collection of the air sample. Other methods of screening may need to be employed to screen \nsuch cargo. Factors such as soak time, temperature, humidity, wind and distractions should also be taken into account \nto ensure that sufficient odour is captured for analysis and avoid false negative outcomes. \n \nAnalysis \n \n13.6.2.12 \nIdeally, analysis of REST samples should be conducted under environmentally controlled factors so as to \navoid affecting detection capabilities negatively. During analysis, filters carrying the air sample are attached to a filter \npresentation system, with varying number of filter holders. The dog is brought to the filter presentation system and, \nshould it detect the scent of explosives, the dog should display positive indicators for the particular filter. \n \nIdentification of consignment \n \n13.6.2.13 \nUpon the positive indication displayed by a REST EDD, the consignment from which the sample led to a \npositive indication should be identified. States may consider the use of a FREDD team in identifying the consignment. \n \n \nConsolidated shipments \n \n13.6.2.14 \nShould the EDD team indicate a positive response from consolidated cargo, the shipment should be \nbroken down for screening at piece level by the EDD again to confirm the exact area of the cargo which led to the \npositive response from the EDD team, before secondary screening is applied. For example, if the package is in a ULD, \nall the packages could be removed along with other packages in the ULD and lined up on the floor for the EDD to \nconduct a positive identification of the package that triggered the positive response. Alternatively, secondary screening \nof the consolidated shipment could be immediately applied, using another screening method.",

These suppliers \nprovide a wide range of items to airport operators, airport tenants and aircraft operators. The security measures and \ncontrols detailed in this chapter should be applied: \n \na) \nupon entering the SRA if no other form of security controls like a secure supply chain process or \nscreening was applied (and the supplies were not protected thereafter against unauthorized \ninterference); \n \n \n3 \nThis section should be read in conjunction with the guidance provided in [14.2] to [14.5] on in-flight supplies.",

Personal GA operations \nusually employ piston-powered single- or twin-engine aeroplanes and light helicopters, while the business and corporate \naviation sector typically utilizes turboprop and turbojet aircraft and medium and large helicopters. \n \n15.4.2 \nAerial work (AW) is an operation in which an aircraft is used for specialized services such as agriculture, \nconstruction, photography, surveying, observation and patrol, search and rescue, aerial advertising, etc. \n \n15.4.3 \nAs a result of the diversity and frequency of GA and AW operations, it is difficult to classify and establish \nsecurity programmes that address all activities. More significantly, the level and geographic dispersion of these activities \nmake effective enforcement very difficult. Therefore, States with significant GA and AW activity and representative \norganizations have formed partnerships with operators to achieve common goals. By working together, a State and its \nmany aircraft operators can establish procedures that meet mutual objectives. \n \n15.4.4 \nEffective security precautions for GA and AW operations are less complex compared to those for \ncommercial air transport operations. In regions where significant GA and AW activity exists, States and aircraft owners \nand operators have adopted voluntary precautions to prevent aircraft theft and tampering, and to reduce an aircraft \nfleet\u2019s vulnerability to use in acts of unlawful interference. \n \n15.4.5 \nAll AW aircraft with a maximum certificated take off mass exceeding 5 700 kg should also be subject to the \nprovisions of large aircraft security procedures, as far as practicable, and in accordance with the appropriate authority. \n \n \nAerial work \n \n15.4.6 \nAerial work operations are defined by ICAO as specialized services. Of particular concern are aircraft that \ncan carry large, bulky or heavy loads, such as those used for firefighting, construction or skydiving operations. \nAdditionally, specialty aircraft, such as those designed for agricultural application and insect control, are of concern \nbecause of their potential for dispensing harmful aerosols. \n \n15.4.7 \nStates should conduct threat assessments of all AW operations to determine whether additional \nprecautions are necessary. Aerial work operators whose activities are deemed to pose a significant threat should be \nrequired to establish and maintain a State approved written security programme that incorporates the following \nprovisions:",

Notwithstanding this, GA \nand AW operations should be protected from two types of threats: the possibility of someone seizing control of an \naircraft and using it as a weapon of destruction; and an act of sabotage, where an explosive device might be placed on \nan aircraft. \n \n15.4.9 \nWhile the threat posed by GA and AW aircraft may be low, States should perform threat assessments on a \ncontinuing basis to determine the type and level of threats facing GA and AW operations and the potential risks \nassociated with specific targets, and to establish requirements for a security programme approach to safeguarding their \noperations. \n \n15.4.10 \nPrior to any threat assessment being undertaken, an aircraft\u2019s actual capacity to cause harm should be \nunderstood. Most GA and AW aircraft are too small to carry the quantity of explosives needed to inflict major destruction \non infrastructure and, consequently, do not pose a significant threat. \n \n15.4.11 \nIn order for a small aircraft to have any destructive impact, careful loading and fusing of explosives would \nbe necessary, and such preparations would require time and expertise. As such, a lengthy clandestine operation would \nbe difficult to accomplish at a busy airport. \n \n15.4.12 \nSmall, remote airports face different threats and threat levels than larger airport facilities located near \nmajor metropolitan areas, and a significantly lower threat than larger airport facilities near urban areas. \n \n15.4.13 \nThe size and capacity of aircraft utilizing an airport should be considered when determining the relative \nthreat, and several analyses may be required for busy airports that accommodate a mixture of large and small aircraft \noperations.

The majority of GA airports are used for aerial work, flight training or \npersonal transportation. A small GA airport may have no locally-based aircraft, and may lack hangars or other buildings \nand infrastructure. A larger GA airport may have multiple paved runways, hundreds of local aircraft and large complexes \nof hangars and other buildings, as well as business facilities. \n \n15.4.19 \nNotably, restricted access to aircraft operating areas at GA airports is more difficult to impose and enforce \ngiven the lack of security infrastructure and personnel. The expense associated with perimeter fencing, apron lighting, \noperating and storage area surveillance and access control are prohibitive for most GA and AW airports. Generally, \nexisting controls imposed at these airports to deter theft and vandalism are adequate to prevent the misuse of aircraft. \n \n15.4.20 \nThe principal method of preventing the misuse of GA and AW aircraft is to prevent unauthorized access to \nan aircraft itself, and the primary means of doing so is to lock flight crew compartment and/or cabin access doors. In \nhigh-risk areas, additional precautions may be necessary, usually involving measures to immobilize the aircraft. \n \n15.4.21 \nA secondary method of preventing the misuse of aircraft is to prevent access to the apron and any hangars \nthrough perimeter security controls. Security fences, locked hangars and operating area access controls also serve as \ncredible deterrents. However, the majority of GA airports are too small to warrant or justify these measures.",

While emergency plans \nare designed to limit the consequences or impact of such incidents, contingency plans are designed to anticipate events \nand prepare all parties concerned for an emergency, as well as enable a return to normal service as quickly as possible. \n \n17.1.3 \nThis chapter covers both emergency and contingency measures and requirements, as part of a crisis \nmanagement plan. \n \n17.1.4 \nFlexible emergency and contingency plans for each type of occurrence as part of a crisis management \nplan should be prepared for each airport in accordance with the requirements of the State\u2019s NCASP, and appropriate \nresources, facilities and personnel should be made available to support the implementation of such plans. \n \nObjectives \n \n17.1.5 \nStates are required to have as their primary objective the safety of passengers, crew, and ground \npersonnel and to take adequate measures to ensure the safety of passengers and crew of an aircraft subjected to an act \nof unlawful interference until their journey can be continued. \n \n17.1.6 \nWhen an aircraft is subjected to an act of unlawful interference in the air, it should land as soon as \npracticable in order for the issue to be resolved. States should therefore ensure that airports remain open and available \nfor use by an aircraft subjected to an act of unlawful interference in the air, and that an aircraft subjected to an act of \nunlawful interference which has landed in their territory is detained on the ground until the issue is resolved, unless its \ndeparture is necessitated by the overriding duty to protect human life. \n \nObligations and responsibilities \n \n17.1.7 \nStates are obliged, under the aviation security conventions, to take adequate measures for the safety of \nthe passengers and crew of an aircraft that is subjected to an act of unlawful interference until their journey can be \ncontinued. This obligation may arise as a consequence of a wide variety of events, ranging from the sabotage of an \naircraft in transit while on the ground, or in the airspace of a State, through to the arrival of a hijacked aircraft at an \nairport. \n \nSensitive Security Information \nDissemination, reproduction or onward distribution of this document is expressly prohibited without the consent of the originators. \n \n17-1",

The aviation sector is therefore increasingly reliant on the availability of information, communications and \ncontrol systems, as well as on the integrity and confidentiality of data. Each stakeholder in the aviation system should \ntherefore identify its critical aviation information systems and implement protective measures using a risk assessment \nmethodology, followed by the essential measures to mitigate vulnerabilities and, when necessary, to respond \nappropriately to an incident. \n \n18.1.2 \nThe threat posed by deliberate cyber-attacks on civil aviation is rapidly and continuously evolving.

When making efforts to protect civil aviation infrastructure from acts of unlawful \ninterference carried out with unmanned aircraft, it is recommended that States undertake appropriate coordination and \nconsultation with all involved stakeholders to ensure a comprehensive and holistic approach to address associated \nthreats and risks. \n \n19.1.2 \nIn terms of scope, the guidance contained in this chapter does not consider the safety, certification and air \ntraffic management issues surrounding the legitimate use of unmanned aircraft (UA) for transportation or other \ncommercial or professional purposes. Rather, it focuses on measures that might be taken by States to prevent, respond \nto, or mitigate the impacts of acts of unlawful interference against civil aviation using UA. \n \n19.1.3 \nMultiple terms are used for unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) and their components. UAS are comprised \nof an unmanned aircraft (UA), a control or remote pilot station (RPS), a data link (C2 Link) between the UA and its \ncontrol station/RPS for managing the flight, and possibly other components such as launch and recovery equipment. \n \n19.1.4 \nRemotely piloted aircraft (RPA) are a subset of UA that may be fully certificated in accordance with aviation \nstandards. Another type of UA is unmanned free balloons. Some Member States may, under their existing legislation, \nalso include model aircraft within the category of small UA. Most UA operate as part of a system (UAS).

These aircraft are very costly and require a sophisticated organization \ninfrastructure to support operations. \n \n \nThreats posed by UAS \n \n19.1.9 \nUAS have become increasingly popular as technological advancements have improved their capability and \nreduced their cost, making them affordable and accessible to the general public. Consequently, the major concerns \nposed by UA in the civil aviation environment are mostly related to the reckless use of UA in airspace and possible \nignorance of the owner/operator. \n \n19.1.10 \nThe inherent difficulty in preventing the acquisition and use of UAS, in addition to the limited ability to track \nthem near airports, results in an overall increased vulnerability to acts of unlawful interference targeting civil aviation \ninfrastructure. Incidents and other developments in the illegal use of UAS as a vector of attack on aviation facilities and \nsystems are increasing the risk from this kind of attack. \n \n19.1.11 \nWhen States are assessing associated threats and risks with UAS, consideration should be given to \nconsulting the Aviation Security Global Risk Context Statement (Doc 10108 \u2013 Restricted) to the extent practicable. \n \n19.1.12 \nWeaponized UA are becoming more advanced and more accessible to terrorists, who have demonstrated \nincreased interest and willingness to use this vector of attack in the civilian environment. Mitigations against such attacks \ncurrently appear to be lagging behind the development of the threat. \n \n19.1.13 \nThe misuse of UA in regulated airspace could impact civil aviation operations and constitutes an act of \nunlawful interference if it endangers aviation safety. This can result in forced closure of an airport over an extended \nperiod, thereby potentially causing safety-related incidents, the cancellation of hundreds of flights, with disruption to tens \nof thousands of passengers and substantial economic damage. \n \n \n \n19.2 \nREGULATORY MEASURES \n \n19.2.1 \nCoordination of responsibilities between State, local, and airport authorities should be in place to allow for \nappropriate agencies to intervene against UA determined as threats to civil aviation.

Many of these possible \nsolutions are aimed at providing a capability to detect, track, identify and mitigate the risks posed by UA, which is a \nnecessary first requirement for counter-UAS technology. Some solutions also offer the capability to disable or destroy \nthe UA, using a range of techniques, including weapons (e.g. ballistics or lasers), capture (using nets or other UA) or \nelectromagnetic interference (e.g. jamming). \n \n19.3.2 \nHowever, since the use of such technologies is still in its infancy, there are currently no agreed upon \nstandards on the matter. It is also important to ensure that none of these technological solutions create another set of \nissues ranging from electromagnetic interference with navigational systems, telecommunications and nearby \ninstallations (e.g. hospitals) to damage on the ground and bodily injury (e.g. when disabling a UA that subsequently may \nfall onto a populated area). \n \n19.3.3 \nWhen developing or acquiring counter-UAS solutions, stakeholders should determine: \n \na) \nwhether they are effective; \n \nb) \nwhich circumstances they work best in;",

A threat zone map along these lines can assist both threat assessment and decision-making \nprocesses, as well the development of mitigation measures. \n \n19.4.2.3 \nThreat zone maps should be provided to airport staff to assist them in reporting UA sightings, to enhance \nsituational awareness and facilitate an effective response to potential incursion. \n \n19.4.2.4 \nAirport operators should develop their own 3D threat zone map in coordination with local ANSPs as follows: \n \na) \nZone A should cover the areas of the runway(s) and immediate approaches within the airport \nperimeter; \n \nb) \nZone B should cover airport property within the airport perimeter or beyond, as applicable; and \n \nc) \nZone C should cover areas of concern outside of the airport perimeter such as approach and \ndeparture paths, fuel supplies and air navigation facilities. \n \n19.4.2.5 \nFigure 19-2 illustrates what such a threat zone map might be. Note that the ceilings of the 3 zones are \nindicative only and should be determined by the relevant authorities.",

Concept of threat zone map and no-fly zone \n \n \n19.4.2.6 \nAirport operators should ensure that their local contingency plan clearly identifies who is responsible for \nmaking decisions under each relevant scenario, taking into account the situation and local circumstances. It should also \nbe recognized that the control of an incident may pass from one entity to another as a situation evolves, in which case \nthe transfer of responsibility should be explicit and clear to all parties. For example, a UA incursion in controlled airspace \nat a significant distance from the airport is likely to be dealt with primarily by the ANSP, before the airport authorities take \nover the response in the event the incursion moves into the airport perimeter. Should the incursion be assessed to be \nmalicious in nature, law enforcement may also need to be involved in the response with the appropriate authority. \n \n19.4.2.7 \nThe decision to resume operations after the occurrence of a security incident involving a UA can be \nextremely difficult. Emergency and incident response procedures developed by operators for UA-related events should \ninclude comprehensive business recovery plans. \n \nUA sighting reporting mechanism \n \n19.4.2.8 \nA plan should include local arrangements for the reporting and handling of information around UA sightings. \nThese should incorporate awareness-raising and reporting processes for ANSP and air traffic control staff, airport staff, \nas well as the local community. \n \n19.4.2.9 \nA plan should therefore include the following: \n \na) \nprotocols for the collection and recording of relevant information in relation to UA sightings; \n \nb) \nprovisions for the prompt communication of UA sightings information to those designated within the \nplan as being responsible for carrying out threat assessments and for making decisions on a \nproportionate response; and \nThreat Zones Legend \nZone A \nZone B \nZone C \nNO DRONE ZONE \nUnauthorized drone \noperations prohibited \nwithin 5 km of \nairport",

Public communications strategies should \nincorporate social media and factor in appropriate deterrence messaging. \n \n19.4.2.10 \nCommunications between air traffic controllers and pilots in flight should be concise and include critical and \nactionable information only. Communications should be provided to assist pilots in their on-board decision-making, and \nshould, where possible, use standardized terminology. \n \n19.4.2.11 \nDrills and real-life exercises should be regularly conducted to ensure all entities and staff involved in \nimplementing the contingency plan understand their roles and responsibilities. Staff should receive initial and recurrent \ntraining that includes some understanding of UAS types and capabilities. More information on crisis management, \nincluding emergency response measures, can be found in Chapter 17. \n \n \n19.5 \nDECISION-MAKING PROCESS \n \n \n19.5.1 \nThreat assessment \n \n19.5.1.1 \nAlthough the vast majority of UA incursions are likely to be accidental (e.g. due to negligence, ignorance of \napplicable measures or loss of control), airport operators and relevant authorities should take appropriate actions to \nrespond to any incursions that may jeopardize aviation safety, whether such incursions are malicious in nature or not. \nShould an incursion be determined to pose a serious and immediate danger to the safety and security of people on the \nground or in the air, a more rapid response should be executed, which may escalate to include measures with significant \noperational and safety impacts (e.g. diversion of air traffic, airspace and runway closure or use of counter-UAS \nmeasures). \n19.5.1.2 \nWhen assessing the threat posed by a UA incursion, a wide range of possible factors needs to be taken \ninto account, including the reliability of the information received, reported location, flight behaviour and direction. \nFollowing this assessment, an appropriate response should be activated in close coordination with all entities involved \nand/or affected by the incursion. \n \n19.5.1.3 \nSuch threat assessments are dynamic due to the limited availability of relevant information at the beginning \nof an event, and therefore need to be conducted repeatedly, sometimes several times, as the event progresses and \nmore information becomes available. However, urgent responses should not be delayed by such repeated assessments. \n \n19.5.1.4 \nStates and airport operators, in collaboration with relevant authorities, should therefore develop their own \nthreat assessment tool to inform appropriate and proportionate decision-making process to respond to UA incursions \nand/or sightings. A template UA incursion threat assessment form can be found in Appendix 45. \n \n19.5.1.5 \nFigure 19-3 provides template decision-making processes starting from the reporting of a UA flying within, \nabove or near a zone of concern, as defined by local contingency plans. It aims to assist authorities in determining \nwhether the threat is credible and should lead to actions. Additional considerations such as the conduct of authorized UA \nactivity should also be taken into account.",

Each NCASP is unique to a State and may contain more or fewer subjects. The programme model focuses on \nnational policy directives rather than specific operational details. \n \n2. \nThe programme model is divided into sections I to XIV. Each section includes explanatory text (printed in \nitalics) to provide guidance in drafting that part of an NCASP. Cross-references to the Aviation Security Manual are \nnoted, if appropriate. Areas for which States should provide specific information are shown in square brackets, for \nexample: [name of State]. \n \n3. \nDocuments that directly support an NCASP, including international airport security programmes (ASPs), \nAOSPs, and aviation security training programmes, should be attached as appendices to an NCASP. \n \n4. \nThese attached documents will contain the methods by which specific organizations in the State, such as \nairport administrations and aircraft operators, will implement the national policy statements included in the NCASP. \nReferences to these documents should be made within the text of the national programme, where appropriate. \n \n5. \nSecurity classification of this programme should be clearly stated on the document. Unnecessarily high \nsecurity classification should be avoided as it can restrict the programme's effective use. This programme model is \nstructured to permit States to include very sensitive information as appendices to the national programme. \n \n6. \nAppendices may then be distributed under strict control only to those persons cleared to receive them. A \nnational programme, without such sensitive appendices attached, can be given a lower classification and be more widely \ndistributed to those with a legitimate need to have access to the more general information contained in the programme. \n \n \n \nNational Civil Aviation Security Programme (NCASP) Model \nCONTENTS \nPreface \n \nI. \nProgramme objective \n \nII. \nDefinitions \n \nIII. \nLegislation \n \n \nSensitive Security Information \nDissemination, reproduction or onward distribution of this document is expressly prohibited without the consent of the originators. \n \nApp 1-1",

If this programme is to be effectively \nimplemented within a State, it is important that all organizations and individuals involved in the programme understand \nits scope and area of application. \n \nThe programme model addresses only international civil aviation activities in a State. However, a State \nmay choose to apply this programme to domestic activities. If so, it should be stated in this section and in other \nappropriate sections of the NCASP. \n \n1. \nThe objective of this NCASP is to protect the safety, regularity and efficiency of international civil aviation in \n[name of State] by providing, through regulations, practices and procedures, the necessary safeguards against acts of \nunlawful interference. The NCASP aims at maintaining the security of national and foreign operators providing services \nfrom [name of State] as well as of civil airports in [name of State] supporting international flights.",

A better understanding of \nterms used in the national programme results in a better understanding of how specific standards and guidelines \ncontained in the programme should be applied. In addition, the standardized use of terms by all States assists in \ninternational cooperation and communication as required in Annex 17. \n \nIt is recommended that States include in this section the terms and definitions found in Chapter 1 of the \nAviation Security Manual (Doc 8973 \u2013 Restricted). In addition, States should include any other terms used in the national \nprogramme. \n \n \n \nIII. \nLEGISLATION \n \n \nA. \nInternational conventions \n \nAnnex 17 to the Chicago Convention contains SARPs for the safeguarding of international civil aviation \nagainst acts of unlawful interference. Articles 37 and 38 of the Convention contain an obligation for States to comply, in \nthe highest practicable degree, with those Standards by incorporating them into their national legislation. \n \nThere are presently eight international instruments that relate to unlawful acts against civil aviation, namely, \nthe Convention on Offences and Certain Other Acts Committed on Board Aircraft (the Tokyo Convention (Doc 8364)); \nthe Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft (The Hague Convention (Doc 8920)); the Convention \nfor the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Civil Aviation (the Montreal Convention (Doc 8966)); and the \nProtocol for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts of Violence at Airports Serving International Civil Aviation, Supplementary \nto the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Civil Aviation, Done at Montreal on \n23 September 1971 (Doc 9518); the Convention on the Marking of Plastic Explosives for the Purpose of Detection (the \nMEX Convention (Doc 9571)); the Convention on the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Relating to International Civil \nAviation (the Beijing Convention (Doc 9960)); the Protocol Supplementary to the Convention for the Suppression of \nUnlawful Seizure of Aircraft (Protocol Supplementary to the Hague Convention, also known as the Beijing Protocol \n(Doc 9959)); and the Protocol to Amend the Convention on Offences and Certain Other Acts Committed on Board \nAircraft (Montr\u00e9al Protocol 2014 (Doc 10034)). These Conventions are international agreements that contain provisions \nby which States that become parties to those Conventions agree to be bound. The provisions in these Conventions are \noften not directly applicable but need to be enacted in the national legislation of States parties. It therefore follows that \nspecific national legislation may be required from States that have become parties to those instruments or intend to do \nso, to bring the relevant terms and provisions of these Conventions into effect.",

These responsibilities could include routine \naviation regulatory activities as well as the provision of air traffic control services during acts of unlawful interference. \n \n \nC. \nAirport administration \n \nIn some States, the airport administration function is not necessarily carried out by the agency responsible \nfor civil aviation. In some cases, it may even be a private organization. It therefore follows that for national policy to be \nimplemented at the airport level, specific responsibilities and authorities should be stipulated.

In order to confirm that air traffic services security \nprogrammes meet the requirements, States are urged to require ATS providers to submit a written security programme \nto the State\u2019s designated appropriate authority for aviation security. The programme can then be reviewed to ensure that \nit complies with the requirements contained in the NCASP. \n \nAir traffic service providers have specific aviation security responsibilities for the provision of air traffic \ncontrol services during an act of unlawful interference, particularly the collection and transmission of information \nregarding an aircraft which is the subject of an act of unlawful interference. \n \nFurther guidance on ATS requirements can be found in Appendix 36.",

The State of the Operator is \nresponsible for ensuring that the Aircraft Operator Security Programme (AOSP) meets the requirements of their NCASP. \nTo achieve this, States, under their national legislation and/or policy, may consider the need to formally approve the \nAOSP and/or subject it to appropriate review or verification processes based on established procedures. \n \nStates other than the State of the Operator require aircraft operators providing service to and from that \nState to establish, implement and maintain written SSPs that meet the requirements of the NCASP of that State. Further \nguidance can be found in Chapter 15. \n \n1. \nAircraft operators providing international service from [name of State] shall implement an Aircraft Operator \nSecurity Programme (AOSP) that meets the requirements of the NCASP.

The responsible military unit and/or commanding official should be \nspecified whenever possible. It should be noted that if the military plays a significant aviation security role in the State, it \nshould be represented on the NCASC and ASCs, as appropriate. \n \n \nI. \nOther agencies \n \nOther governmental and non-governmental agencies often have responsibility for performing specific \naviation security functions within a State.

One individual within the authority should be assigned as the primary information officer, and \nall communications to the media should be channelled through this individual. Use this section to describe this process. \n \n \n \nVI. \nPROTECTION OF AIRPORTS, AIRCRAFT, \nAND AIR NAVIGATION FACILITIES \n \n \nA. \nDesignation of security restricted areas \n \nIt is essential when considering the protection of aircraft and airport facilities that the first element be the \ncontrol of access to the area. In order to do this effectively, security restricted areas should be defined in clear terms. In \norder for security personnel to control access to such areas, they must be given legal support. Legislation can only be \neffective once security restricted areas are designated, prohibiting access to all except authorized persons, and creating \noffenses and stipulating penalties for unauthorized access. \n \n1. \nIt is the responsibility of [designated appropriate authority for aviation security] in conjunction with airport \nmanagement and others concerned to identify areas where operations vital to the continued security of civil aviation in \n[name of State] are carried out, and to designate these areas as security restricted areas. \n \n2. \nThe [designated appropriate authority for aviation security] shall prepare and certify plans delineating the \narea and boundaries of any security restricted area. As and when necessary, substitute or amended plans shall be \nprepared and certified by this authority. \n \n3. \nAccess to these designated security restricted areas shall be controlled in accordance with the procedures \nstipulated herein and the respective ASPs, and in compliance with [local legislation dealing with access control].",

Aircraft operators should be given the responsibility for implementing \nappropriate security measures to prevent such an occurrence. \n \n1. \nAircraft operators shall include in their respective security programmes and implement appropriate security \nprocedures and controls to prevent the introduction of weapons, explosives and other dangerous devices into catering \nstores and supplies intended for carriage on international passenger flights. \n \n2. \nIn-flight catering companies, both on- and off-airport, shall include in their respective security programmes, \nand implement, appropriate security procedures and controls to prevent unauthorized access to their facilities and the \nintroduction of weapons, explosives and other dangerous devices into catering stores and supplies intended for carriage \non international passenger flights. Off-airport in-flight catering companies shall ensure that catering supplies are \nprotected from unauthorized access while en route from the catering facility to the airport. \n \n \n \nVIII. \nSECURITY EQUIPMENT \n \nIndividual airport, aircraft operator or tenant security programmes should provide details of the type, \nnumber and location of equipment used in aviation security preventive measures by the differing authorities. The \nNCASP should contain the national policy towards equipment, providing the means to authorize the purchase of \nequipment meeting the minimum requirements of the State by the various authorities and prescribing the calibration, \noperation and maintenance standards to be followed by all equipment users. \n \n \nA. \nProcurement \n \nList here the national standards related to the procurement of aviation security equipment, including the \nbasic minimum standards for X-ray equipment used to screen baggage, walk-through metal detectors (WTMDs), hand- \nheld metal detectors (HHMDs), and other security equipment in use or planned to be introduced. It is highly \nrecommended that States include a requirement for a maintenance technician package within the terms of any purchase \ncontract. \n \n \nB. \nCalibration \n \nThe requirement for calibration of equipment is to ensure that each piece of security equipment in \noperation, irrespective of its location, is calibrated to operate at identical predetermined standards. This calibration \nmainly concerns pre-boarding screening equipment, in particular, metal detection equipment. This section of the \nprogramme should stipulate the requirement for the sensitivity setting of the equipment in normal operations, i.e. to \ncorrespond to what is required to be detected, with an enhanced sensitivity setting for a higher level of threat. States \nshould reference international ASPs as appropriate. Determination of base alarm thresholds, or the point at which \nequipment alarms are activated, is best accomplished through field trials utilizing an approved test piece to simulate the \nobject to be detected. Increased sensitivity is based on increased threat situations. \n \n \nC. \nOperation and maintenance",

The majority of such notifications are made to air traffic control centres from aircraft in the \nair, law enforcement agencies and airport administrations. \n \n1. \nAll organizations receiving information that indicates that an act of unlawful interference is about to be, is in \nprogress, or has been committed, shall take such alerting action as specified in [the appropriate contingency plan]. \n \n2. \nThe course of action to be taken shall include dissemination of the message to all concerned in \naccordance with the appropriate contingency plan, the assessment of the message and an agreement on a plan of \naction among those concerned. \n \n3. \nThe organization receiving such a notification is responsible for gathering and recording as much \ninformation as possible on the message to allow an accurate assessment of the incident to be made. \n \n4. \nA clear, logical assessment must be made of the information on the evidence available before deciding on \nfurther action. It is the responsibility of the [entity responsible for the conduct of threat assessments] to undertake this \nassessment in conjunction with the receiver of the information and any other concerned party such as an aircraft or \nairport operator. In the conduct of an assessment, use should be made of positive target identification to classify the \nthreat as specific, non-specific or a hoax. Positive target identification, in the context of incident notifications, requires \nthat the notification contain specific reference to the target concerned, for example, in the case of an aircraft by quoting \nthe flight number, departure time or actual location at the time of notification, and include other specific information that \nadds positive credibility to the notification. The policy for determining whether a positive target identification exists is \nstrictly confidential, the details of which should be known only by [the designated authority]. \n \n5. \nOnce an assessment has been made, it is disseminated to all concerned, and further action taken in \naccordance with [appropriate contingency plan]. \n \n6. \nIf a well-founded suspicion exists that an aircraft may be the object of an act of unlawful interference: \n \na) \nthe aircraft operator shall be notified by [relevant national authority]; and \n \nb) \nan inspection of the aircraft shall be conducted. \n \n7. \nIf a well-founded suspicion exists that an aircraft may be attacked while on the ground: \n \na) \nappropriate airport authorities shall be notified as soon as possible by [relevant national authority]; and \n \nb) \nappropriate measures to safeguard the aircraft shall be taken as specified in the [name of airport \ncontingency plan].",

As noted in the ICAO Aviation \nSecurity Global Risk Context Statement (Doc 10108 \u2013 Restricted), terrorists consistently look to exploit vulnerabilities in \nsecurity controls and commit acts of unlawful interference (AUI) against aviation, which could be facilitated through the \nexploitation of insiders. \n \n \nA. \nWho are insiders? \n \nInsiders are full or part-time employees (including contractors, temporary and self-employed personnel) who are working \nin or for the aviation sector whose role provides them with privileged access and/or knowledge to secured locations, \nitems or sensitive security information. \n \n \nB. \nWhat is the insider threat? \n \nThe insider threat refers to the risk arising from aviation employees conducting or facilitating an AUI through use of their \nauthorized access, thereby giving them a tactical advantage. \n \n \nC. \nWhat is the rationale of an insider? \n \n1. \nInsiders may conduct or facilitate an AUI through a lack of awareness, complacency or maliciousness. \nLack of awareness of policies and procedures and complacency (lax approach to policies and procedures) can cause \ninsiders to unintentionally facilitate an AUI through their negligence, inaction or failure to follow security policies and \nprocedures. \n \n2. \nOn the other hand, malicious insiders \u2013 those who make a conscious decision to conduct an AUI \u2013 may be \ndriven by a mix of personal vulnerabilities, life events and situational factors, such as financial gain, ideology, revenge, \ndesire for recognition, or coercion. \n \n3. \nA malicious insider could deliberately seek to join an organization to conduct an AUI or acquire the \nintention of doing so during their employment (e.g. recruitment by a third party to exploit their trusted position). \n \n \nD. \nHow can insiders act? \n \nInsiders can conduct any AUI (e.g. destruction of an aircraft in service, introduction of a weapon or hazardous device or \nmaterial intended for criminal purposes on board an aircraft or at an airport). Insiders can share confidential information, \nfacilitate access to restricted areas, perform their roles inadequately enabling the introduction of prohibited articles into \nrestricted areas, help external parties to obtain access to computer systems or other digital infrastructure1, etc. \n \n \n \n \n \n1 \nDigital Infrastructure means assets primarily related to mobile and internet communications.",

In general, these measures seek to reduce the risk of recruiting staff who may present a security concern by \ntheir actions; minimize the likelihood of existing employees becoming a security concern; reduce the risk of insider \nactivity; and protect an organization\u2019s assets. \n \n2. \nInsider threat mitigation measures and tools can be grouped by the following areas: \n \n \nA. \nBACKGROUND CHECKS AND \nVETTING \nPolicies and procedures: Robust policies and procedures on \nbackground checks, including employee\u2019s identity, previous work \nexperience, criminal history and educational background, are a \ncornerstone of any framework aimed at mitigating the threat posed by \ninsiders. Such policies and procedures must be clear and concise and \nshould be periodically reviewed. \nInitial background checks: All employees that need unescorted \naccess to airside and security restricted areas, and persons with \naccess to sensitive security information, must undergo background \nchecks2 as specified by the appropriate authority. \nInitial background checks should cover: \n\uf0a7 \nidentity (e.g. provision of a passport, identity card, records of \nregistry of birth, etc.); \n\uf0a7 \ncharacter/reference check (e.g. to check integrity or any \ncriminal history, etc.); and \n\uf0a7 \nemployment history (e.g. previous employers, educational \nhistory, etc.). \nRecurrent background checks: Background checks should be \nrecurrent and updated on a regular basis as part of cyclical personnel \nsecurity checks. It is good practice to update a background check \nevery time airport identification permits need to be renewed. \nThose who commit an illegal act or AUI using insider access or \nknowledge often acquire the intention to do so after employment has \nbeen secured. Additionally, many insiders may have already attracted \nmanagement\u2019s attention (e.g. through breaches of discipline and poor \nperformance), which should be taken into consideration during the \nrecurrent background check process. \n \n \n \n2 \nStandard 3.5.2 in Annex 17 \u2013 Aviation Security (Twelfth Edition, Amendment 18)",
  "560": "App 10-4 \nAviation Security Manual \nSensitive Security Information \nDissemination, reproduction or onward distribution of this document is expressly prohibited without the consent of the originators. \n \n \n \nContinuous vetting: A continuous vetting process should be \nencouraged, in collaboration with the relevant appropriate authorities \n(and where relevant, with authorities from other States). This is to \nassess whether an employee continues to meet applicable \nemployment requirements. \nEnhanced background checks: Background checks that cover \nintelligence (and any other relevant information available on the \nsuitability of a person to work in a function) could be useful. Indeed, \nStates may collaborate with the relevant competent national authorities \nto incorporate some enhanced data into the layered background check \nand vetting process. \nEqually, if staff identify suspicious or unusual behaviour in a person, \nthen the relevant security and local competent authorities should be \ncontacted, as an enhanced intelligence background check might be \nnecessary. \nB. \nTRAINING AND AWARENESS \nAwareness training: Security awareness and security culture training \nshould be encouraged for all staff. This will help ensure that all \npersonnel know the security policies, standards, guidelines and \nprocedures, as well as understand their purpose in maintaining a high \nlevel of security. This training will also enable new employees to \ndevelop the ability to identify and safely report suspicious behaviours to \nthe appropriate authority or law enforcement officer/agency, including \nthrough anonymous means. \nTraining integration: Security awareness could be integrated into \ninitial and existing recurrent training or through the use of campaign \nmaterial, workshops, drop-in sessions, etc. to promote a strong and \neffective security culture in aviation. \nRole-specific training: For some staff, including but not limited to \nsupervisors, managers and those with personnel security \nresponsibilities, more in-depth, role-specific training will be appropriate \nto tailor targeted training outcomes. \nAwareness campaigns: Visual messaging covering key security \naspects should be developed for display within organizations and \nairport environments in order to serve as visual reminders to staff. \nC. \nACCESS CONTROL MEASURES \nScreening: Access control measures should be in place to ensure that \npersons other than passengers, together with items carried, are \nscreened prior to entry into airport security restricted areas3. Such \nscreening should incorporate some random and unpredictable \n \n \n3 \nStandard 4.2.5 Annex 17 \u2013 Aviation Security (Twelfth Edition, Amendment 18)",

Additionally, patrolling should not only focus on the \nsurveillance of airport personnel but include passengers, other airport \nstakeholders, and airport infrastructure and goods for signs of unusual \nactivity or poor security. \nPatrolling can be effective as a visual deterrent if personnel are in \nuniform and use marked vehicles. Alternatively, patrolling can provide \nincreased surveillance if conducted covertly. \nE. \nSURVEILLANCE AND MONITORING \nMethods: Quality control and monitoring of processes and employees \nspecific to the insider threat can play an important role in avoiding or \nquickly addressing security incidents and AUIs. Methods of \nsurveillance include CCTV, reviewing systems logs (e.g. access \nrequests), and surveillance by staff on the ground. \nSupervisors also play a critical role in recognizing and monitoring \nunusual activities and behaviours of the employees that they oversee. \nData: In some organizations, employee data can be found in various",

This \ndigital data can highlight work patterns and be used as a tool to \ndetermine if any malicious intent exists amongst airport staff (e.g. \naccessing areas for which there is no operational need). \nApplications could include: \n\uf0a7 \nPhysical entry/exit logs, with a primary focus on time and \naccess to physical spaces; \n\uf0a7 \nLog-on/log-off records, with a focus on time- and user- \nmatching credentials; \n\uf0a7 \nEmail application logs; and \n\uf0a7 \nDatabase application logs. \nF. \nREPORTING MECHANISMS \nReporting suspicious behaviour: Reporting mechanisms should \ninvolve everyone throughout the organization \u2013 not just those directly \ninvolved in security. These are important because employees are the \n\u2018eyes\u2019, \u2018ears\u2019 and \u2018voice\u2019 of an organization. \nReporting mechanisms may be set up so that employees can safely \nreport suspicious behaviours or incidents through texts, emails, phone \ncalls, social media channels, or by speaking to someone in person. \nSecurity reports should receive a clear, effective, and quick response. \nAnonymous or confidential reporting can be very useful to help mitigate \npotential insider threats and to establish an effective security culture in \nthe organization. \nG. \nBEHAVIOUR DETECTION4 \nBehaviour detection: A useful tool to help mitigate the insider threat \ncan be behaviour detection. It is based on the premise that people may \ndisplay signs of suspicious or unusual behaviour, and that these signs \ncan be picked up by people who have been properly trained. \nTraining: Giving staff an understanding of what is suspicious activity \nand unusal behaviour, as well as an understanding of how to report it, \ncan be a useful tool. \nBehaviour detection training should target a broad range of personnel, \nincluding, but not limited to, those involved in issuing passes, \nconducting background checks, and screening. However, all staff could \n \n \n \n4  Behaviour detection is the application of techniques involving the recognition of behavioural characteristics, including but not \nlimited to physiological or gestural signs indicative of anomalous behaviour (a combination of verbal and non-verbal signs) to \nidentify persons with a potential intent to commit an act of unlawful interference.",

Open communication between employees and \nmanagement should be encouraged and leaders should have an \nunderstanding of the operational day-to-day pressures on the \nworkforce, and the insider risks those pressures may create. \nAn executive (e.g. senior-level manager) who takes ownership of \nsecurity risk principles, implements a top-down approach to security \npolicies, and exemplifies expected behaviours is likely to promote a \nmore compliant and consistent approach across the organization, \nfurther helping to mitigate insider threats. \nStrategy: An insider threat mitigation strategy (endorsed by leadership) \nis recommended for helping employees understand how to recognize \nand how to report suspicious behaviours within the workplace. \nThe strategy can also include personnel-related insider policies, \nguidelines, and procedures. These include actions to be taken prior to \nemployment and throughout an employee\u2019s time with the organization. \nThe strategy and associated policies should be reviewed regularly with \nall key stakeholders. \nFramework documents6, handbooks, and guidance material7 can be \nadditional useful tools. \n \n \n5 \nAdditional information on security culture (including ICAO security culture resources) can be found on the ICAO Security Culture \nwebsite at www.icao.int/Security/Security-Culture/Pages/default.aspx. \n6 E.g. www.cpni.gov.uk/insider-risks/insider-risk-mitigation-framework \n7 E.g. www.iata.org/contentassets/e55ae27b2fc34343a1143fca5129c8dd/insider-threats-position.pdf",

HUMAN FACTORS \nHuman Performance and Factors: Organizations must have an \nunderstanding of how human performance can help mitigate the \ninsider threat. This includes being aware of how human factors can \nimpact individuals, who may either intentionally or unintentionally use \ntheir unique access to cause an AUI. Leaders and senior management \nshould: \n\uf0b7 \ndevelop an understanding of human capabilities and how \nthese can help mitigate the risk of insider activity; \n\uf0b7 \nunderstand human limitations and how these can be \naccommodated to ensure they do not impact performance; \n\uf0b7 \nmake it easy for staff to report security concerns and \nsuspicious behaviours; \n\uf0b7 \nunderstand the link between human factors, security culture \nand motivation; \n\uf0b7 \nensure the availability of resources needed by personnel; \n\uf0b7 \nensure supervisory staff are able to identify signs of stress \nand fatigue in order to deal with them promptly; and \n\uf0b7 \navoid complacency in day-to-day activities. \nK. ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES8 \nExplosives Trace Detection (ETD): Use of ETD machines can add an \nadditional layer of security to the standard non-passenger screening \nprocedures and/or random and unpredictable security \ncountermeasures employed throughout the security restricted area, \nthereby helping to mitigate the insider threat. \nExplosive Detection Dogs (EDDs): EDD teams can be used to serve \nmany purposes such as: security screening in all areas of the airport \n(landside, airside, passengers, non-passengers, baggage, cargo, etc.), \nsweeping security restricted areas and providing a means of \nimplementing random and unpredictable security measures. \nArtificial Intelligence (AI): Use of AI-based systems by trained \nemployees can help to identify trends and abnormal activities. E.g. \nmodern incident management solutions can help identify incidents and \ndifferentiate mundane events from imminent threats, such as attempted \nbreak-ins into secured areas. \n \n \n \n \n8 Application of advanced technologies may assist with mitigation of the insider risk through increased detection standards during the \nsecurity screening process and/or by adding additional layers of security above the security baseline when applied in a random and \nunpredictable manner throughout the airport environment.",

This includes the identification or observation of a vulnerability in the protection of civil \naviation against acts of unlawful interference. \n \nSecurity Incident: A designation given to a security occurrence which affects or could affect the safety of passengers, \ncrew, ground personnel and the general public. Security incidents are designated by a security official or manager \nto a reported security occurrence based on an analysis of the occurrence and a determination that additional action \nis required. A security incident may also result in an act of unlawful interference that would require additional \nreporting to ICAO (Annex 17 Standard 5.3.1 and Appendix 42 in this manual refer). \n \nSensitive Security Information \nDissemination, reproduction or onward distribution of this document is expressly prohibited without the consent of the originators. \n \nApp 11-1",

Harmonization could also create opportunities for sub- \nregional, regional and international analysis of security incidents based on interlinked taxonomies. \n \n5. \nThis guidance is intended to assist all stakeholders in the aviation security environment to develop, \nimplement and maintain an effective and efficient reporting system for security occurrences and incidents. This guidance \ntakes into account existing reporting systems, to include those used in the safety environment, \u201cJust Culture\u201d, and \nreporting of unruly and disruptive passengers (more information can be found in Chapter 9 and Chapter 16 in this \nmanual, respectively). \n \n \nIII. \nSECURITY OCCURRENCES AND SECURITY INCIDENTS \n \n1. \nEvents and activities that appear to be abnormal, unusual, strange, etc. should be reported internally or \ndirectly to authorities through appropriate channels by any person. For example, a witness could inform airport staff or \nthe police about a piece of luggage left unaccompanied in a public area, or in the case of an access door kept open \nwhen it should be securely closed. If that observation, impression, feeling, or activity is not reported, then it is lost even if \nit could have been a good indicator or precursor for security analysts.",

A security incident \nis potentially threatening and could lead to harming the public, staff, and/or crew, to disruption of service, to loss of \nreputation, and should always be taken seriously. \n \n \nA. \nSecurity Occurrence Reporting Process and Timeline \n \n1. \nThe reporting process of security occurrences should take into account the following elements: \n \na) \nsecurity occurrences can be reported by staff, crew, ground personnel, the public and/or passengers, \nregardless of whether or not they are fully trained to identify security precursors or nuances; \n \nb) \nthe instructions and tools for reporting security occurrences should be simple and accessible to all; \n \nc) \nreporting security occurrences within an entity or an organization could be an internal mandatory \nprocess for all staff (implemented by virtue of internal quality control, Security Management Systems, \netc.). In that case, the reporting of security occurrences is performed by the staff to its designated \nsecurity official or manager as per internal procedures; \n \nd) \nsecurity occurrences could also be reported directly to authorities via dedicated interfaces; \n \ne) \nall security occurrences reported should be analysed by an appropriate security official or manager to \ndetermine if it rises to the level of a security incident, and to ensure corrective action(s) are taken \nif/when necessary; and \n \nf) \na log of security occurrences reports should be maintained together with the action(s) taken. \n \n2. \nAs time could be of the essence, all security occurrences should be reported as soon as possible, and \nideally the same day of the occurrence, keeping in mind that individuals reporting an occurrence may need time to \nprocess what they have observed. \n \n \nB. \nSecurity Occurrence Reporting Content \n \n1. \nAs the content of occurrence reporting should help in constructing the official incident report, it is advisable \nthat existing occurrence reporting systems (by entities, operators, etc.) may be adjusted to contain at least the following \nelements: \n \na) \nlocation of the occurrence, using if possible official designation; \n \nb) \nexact date and time of the occurrence; \n \nc) \na description of the occurrence that is as precise as possible; \n \nd) \nname of the person reporting (if possible); and",

In general, it should consist of a \nfactual description of the reported event and an interpretation of the facts. In any case, it should be proportionate to the \nlevel of risk associated with the event. Thus, for the least significant occurrences, the analysis may be reduced to a \nsimple evaluation and a closure without follow-up. Conversely, the most significant occurrences will be analysed in depth. \n \n \nC. \nSecurity Incident Reporting Process and Timeline \n \n1. \nWhen a security occurrence has been designated a security incident, several actions need to take place: \n \na) \nimmediate corrective actions should be taken to address vulnerabilities identified in the report; \n \nb) \nthe information contained in the security occurrence report, together with the analysis and corrective \nactions initiated by the security official or manager, should be compiled into a security incident report \nto be shared with the appropriate authorities; and \n \nc) \nall reports and actions should be recorded for quality control and auditing purposes. \n \n2. \nThe reporting of security incidents to the appropriate authorities should be performed as soon as possible \nafter an occurrence is designated as an incident. Doing so will help facilitate timely corrective actions and/or the further \nsharing of information, as appropriate, to address vulnerabilities. \n \n3. \nThe immediate reporting of security incidents to the appropriate authorities is also essential in the event \nother security incidents are occurring locally, nationally or internationally, that are linked and/or are indicators that a \nsecurity threat is evolving. Nonetheless, some reporting systems may categorize security incidents into levels of severity \nand assign different reporting timeline requirements.

An overly complex system may discourage reporting or result in inaccurate reporting; \ntherefore the system should be designed to promote positive reporting cultures with ease of use in mind. The system \nshould capture all relevant information about an occurrence, including what happened, where, when, and to whom the \nreport is intended. \n \nStates are required to define processes for the reporting of information concerning aviation security incidents to the \nrelevant national authorities by any entity responsible for the implementation of the NCASP, as illustrated in \nFigure A11-2. \n \n2. \nStates should supplement their national civil aviation security quality control programme by establishing a \nconfidential reporting system for analysing security information provided by sources such as passengers, crew and \nground personnel as per Annex 17 requirements and in [7.2.8] \u201cGathering of information from outside sources\u201d. \n \n3. \nAviation security reporting systems (as a part of \u201cSecurity Culture\u201d processes) are outlined in Chapter 9 in \nthis manual).",

This will \nenable States to undertake risk assessment and formulate mitigating measures, conduct root cause analysis, identify \ncontributing factors and monitor trends and patterns in aviation security. \n \n2. \nStates should have processes in place to measure the effectiveness of current security procedures. These \nprocesses enable States to identify and close gaps in current regulations and national programmes. States will be able \nto define priorities in policy as well as establish updates of aviation security measures, which may include a change in \npolicy, where applicable. States will be able to initiate appropriate investigation, and will be able to share relevant \ninformation with other States and entities as deemed necessary. \n \n3. \nStates and stakeholders should establish, implement and maintain procedures outlining threat and risk \nassessment roles and responsibilities in order to be capable of addressing any immediate threats to aviation security. \n \n \nC. \nProtection of the Information \n \n1. \nSome, if not all, information in security occurrence and incident reports may need to be handled as \nsensitive aviation security information, including the identity of the authors. \n \n2. \nSecurity data and information contained in security reports should be shared on a need-to-know basis and \nfor the purposes of addressing vulnerabilities and enhancement of the aviation security system. More information on \nsensitive aviation security information can be found in Chapter 2 of this manual.",
  "572": "App 11-8 \nAviation Security Manual \nSensitive Security Information \nDissemination, reproduction or onward distribution of this document is expressly prohibited without the consent of the originators. \n \n \n \nD. \nTraining and Awareness \n \n1. \nTraining, awareness actions and security culture are critical for an effective implementation of any \nreporting system of security occurrences and security incidents. \n \n2. \nA lack of understanding of the purpose and utility of security occurrence and incident reporting can result in \nserious vulnerabilities remaining unrevealed to concerned operators, authorities, and entities. Staff, stakeholder and \npublic engagement, as well as the integration of a reporting culture in daily activities, is essential for the collective \nsuccess and protection of the ecosystem. \n \n3. \nTraining of managers and supervisors for the purpose and value of security occurrence reporting and \nincident reporting as a continuous risk management and Security Management System performance tool is fundamental \nto maintaining a healthy aviation security ecosystem. \n \n4. \nWhen conducting exercises, the security occurrence and incident reporting process should be tested and \npracticed. This gives the opportunity to identify issues with the process in a non-urgent matter while also increasing \nfamiliarization with roles and responsibilities. \n \n5. \nGiven that there could exist several different legislative requirements linked to security occurrence and \nincident reporting, States could consider providing a consolidated best practice document that outlines key requirements \nand procedures to provide stakeholders a clear understanding of what is expected. \n \n6. \nSeveral training tools and programmes on security occurrence and incident reporting are available through \nICAO, States, organizations, and industry stakeholders. All entities who operate within the aviation ecosystem should be \nencouraged to undertake initial and recurrent training on security occurrence and incident reporting for their job function. \nThis could also be a required competency in order to maintain job certification, where applicable. \n \n7. \nPublic campaigns that use posters, videos and/or social media can be a useful tool to educate and \nencourage security occurrences reporting from the general public as well as those who work in the aviation environment. \nExamples of such public campaigns can be found on the ICAO Security Culture website1. \n \n \n \nV. \nTAXONOMY \n \n1. \nThe establishment of a clear taxonomy and harmonized procedure for reporting of aviation security \noccurrences and incidents, together with development of a global and harmonized secure tool for reporting, would \nfurther encourage the aviation security incident reporting process and increase the probability of reporting of security \nincidents affecting civil aviation, which will result in the development of a strong security culture. \n \n2. \nSecurity data should ideally be categorized using taxonomies and supporting definitions so that the data \ncan be captured and stored using meaningful terms. Common taxonomies and definitions establish a standard language, \nimproving the quality of information and communication. \n \n3. \nThe main focus of these guidelines is on harmonizing security incident reporting taxonomy, which aims to \nfacilitate analysis and information sharing, and exchange between the State and industry stakeholders (in particular the \n \n \n1 \nhttps://www.icao.int/Security/Security-Culture/Pages/default.aspx",

The provisions of Annex 18 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation \u2013 The Safe Transport of \nDangerous Goods by Air \u2013 govern their international transport by air. The broad provisions of Annex 18 are \nsupplemented by the detailed specifications of the Technical Instructions for the Safe Transport of Dangerous Goods by \nAir (Doc 9284), also referred to as the \u201cTechnical Instructions\u201d. \n \n2. \nThe Technical Instructions distinguish between dangerous goods transported as cargo and dangerous \ngoods carried by passengers and crew. Dangerous goods are regularly shipped as cargo on both passenger and \nall-cargo aircraft. With the exception of a small number of permitted items, they are forbidden to be carried by \npassengers or crew members either as cabin or as hold baggage or on the person. \n \n3. \nDangerous goods are divided into various classes or divisions according to the hazard they present. The \nTechnical Instructions provide a list of over 3 000 dangerous goods indicating the class or division into which each falls \nas well as its acceptability for transport as cargo by air and under what conditions. Some dangerous goods are identified \nas too dangerous ever to be carried on any aircraft; some are forbidden under normal circumstances but may be carried \nwith specific approval from the States concerned; some are restricted to carriage on all-cargo aircraft only; but most may \nbe carried as cargo on both passenger and all-cargo aircraft, subject to meeting the required conditions. \n \n4. \nAlthough the primary task of airport security screeners is the detection of prohibited items, they also have a \nrole to play in the safety of aviation by detecting dangerous goods in passenger cabin and hold baggage. \n \n5. \nExamples of dangerous goods forbidden for carriage by passengers and crew include: \n \na) \nexplosives such as grenades, fireworks, and flares; \n \nb) \ngases such as propane and butane; \n \nc) \nflammable liquids such as gasoline and methanol; \n \nd) \nflammable solids and reactive substances such as magnesium and firelighters; \n \ne) \noxidizing substances and/or organic peroxides such as bleach and car body repair kits; \n \nf) \ntoxic and/or infectious substances such as rat poison and infected blood; \n \ng) \nradioactive material such as medicinal or commercial isotopes; \n \nh) \ncorrosive substances such as mercury and vehicle batteries; and \n \ni) \nmiscellaneous dangerous substances and articles such as vehicle fuel system components that have \ncontained fuel.",

This list should be used only as a guide to what \nis permitted and forbidden in passenger or crew baggage. Dangerous goods not contained in the list are forbidden from \ncarriage on aircraft by passengers and crew. \n \n \n \nDISCOVERY OF UNDECLARED DANGEROUS GOODS CARRIED BY \nPASSENGERS AND CREW \n \n7. \nIf a screener discovers an item that is believed to be dangerous goods not permitted for carriage by \npassengers, the matter should be referred to supervisory staff who, in turn, should refer the item to an appropriate \ndangerous goods expert at the airport for resolution. With regard to such matters, the depth of training of screeners \nshould be commensurate with the responsibilities of staff. If suspicions remain or it is confirmed that the item is not \npermitted, the aircraft operator must be notified for further action and the item not permitted to be loaded on board the \naircraft. Additionally, the Technical Instructions state that any relevant operators (i.e. aircraft operators, airports, security \nscreeners, customs authorities, cargo operators) must report whenever dangerous goods not permitted for carriage are \ndiscovered in a passenger\u2019s or crew member\u2019s baggage, or on their person, to the appropriate authority of the State in \nwhich the item was discovered. Undeclared or mislabelled dangerous goods should follow the reporting requirements of \nthe Technical Instructions. \n \n \n \nIDENTIFICATION OF DANGEROUS GOODS \n \n8. \nThere are two primary tools that can be used to help identify dangerous goods packages which have been \noffered for transport as cargo: \n \na) \nmarking on the packaging, including the proper shipping name, class number or numbers and/or a \nunique four-digit UN number, for example, Gasoline, Class 3, UN 1203; and \n \nb) \nlabels designed to correspond to the classes and divisions of dangerous goods, as shown in \nAttachment C. \n \n9. \nThe existence of these marks or labels on packages carried by passengers and crew may be an indication \nof the presence of dangerous goods which they are not permitted to carry. \n \n \n \nLEAKAGE OR DAMAGE \n \n10. \nCertain basic actions should be taken upon discovery of leakage or damage of suspected dangerous \ngoods carried by passengers and crew, including: \n \na) \navoid contact with item;",

However, security designs should, at a \nminimum: \n \na) \nintegrate security functions into the entire building and immediate surroundings so as to maintain an \nefficient use of space for processing passengers, baggage, cargo and commercial items sold or used \nat an airport, without sacrificing the needs of facilitation and commercial processes; and \n \nb) \nfacilitate the implementation of airport emergency and contingency plans during an incident. \n \n1.5 \nSecurity designs should also take into account the threat that explosive or incendiary devices place on any \nlarge publicly accessed structure, and ensure that any effects of an explosion or fire are minimized by: \n \na) \nensuring that structures and fittings are designed so as to limit casualties and damage in the event of \nan attack using explosive or incendiary devices; \n \nb) \nensuring that materials used in construction are capable of withstanding the effects of explosions and \nvarious forms of armed attack; and \n \nc) \nproviding enhanced levels of protection for vulnerable or high-risk areas. \n \n1.6 \nThe current and projected economic feasibility of airports is a major component of any decision to develop \nairport facilities. As such, most new airport designs include commercial spaces for revenue generation. The impact that \nsecurity measures can have on these initiatives should be considered in the planning stage. \n \n1.7 \nSpace requirements for various security processes, including equipment for both front-line and behind-the- \nscenes operational processes, should be addressed in the design stage.

The criteria should allow the architects and designers sufficient flexibility to respond to the \ncircumstances of each airport and its operations, by allowing a range of options for achieving the desired security \nobjectives and by encouraging architects and designers to identify innovative approaches and assess the degree of \nexposure or risk to which a building or facility may be subjected under normal operating conditions and under \nheightened threat levels. \n \n3.3 \nIn establishing national criteria, the appropriate authority should ensure that the security requirements are \nrealistic and economically viable, and establish an appropriate balance between the needs of aviation security, safety, \noperations and facilitation. National criteria should also include provisions to ensure that designs facilitate the \nimplementation of contingency measures. These criteria should be available to industry so that they can be included in \nplanning stages. \n \n3.4 \nDesigners should understand the security concerns and the manner in which the criteria for planning and \ndesigning airport facilities address those concerns.

States should identify the risks associated with each \nmode of transportation, and make appropriate provisions in the design of the airport layout. Ideally, an airport should \nhave one access road for taxis and shuttles and a separate access road, clearly segregated from the first, for personal \nvehicles and public buses. Only taxis and shuttles should have access to the front of the terminal building, and personal \nvehicles and public buses should only access parking or offload areas. \n \n4.3 \nTo the extent practicable, trains or subway stations should not be located behind terminal areas, but rather \nbehind the offload areas of public buses. \n \n \nAirport parking \n \n4.4 \nParking areas should be situated away from terminal buildings to mitigate the risk of damage to the \nterminal from a vehicle-borne IED. Short-term parking of not more than 24 hours should be closest to the terminal, with \nstrict control of entering vehicles. If a vehicle remains parked for longer than 24 hours, the relevant authorities should \nremove the vehicle from short-term parking to long-term parking. \n \n \nSupport operations \n \n4.5 \nA comprehensive list of support operations and other non-aviation activities should be drawn up during the \nplanning stage so that a decision can be made concerning the location of each of these activities. The following basic \nprinciples should govern such planning: \n \na) \nthe number of non- and para-aviation activities located on the airside should be restricted as much as \npossible, except for those that have a direct and continual link with air transport operations; \n \nb) \nif facilities for support operations and other non-aviation activities do have to be located on the airside, \nthey should: \n \n1) \nbe located away from the airport\u2019s passenger and cargo buildings and vulnerable points; and \n \n2) \nwhenever possible, be isolated within the airside area; and",

The security principle to be followed is that of segregation, the purpose of which is to keep the movement \nof persons and vehicles between the general aviation area and the main terminal areas to the strict minimum. Such \nmovement relates mainly to fuelling operations, meteorological services and the aerodrome control reporting office. \n \n \nAirside development \n \n4.7 \nThe perimeter of the airport is the border between the landside and the airside. The perimeter of security \nrestricted areas may be defined by a natural boundary, free-standing fences or walls, or the outer walls of a building or \ndivisions within them. The perimeter\u2019s function is to provide a degree of physical, psychological or legal deterrence to \nintrusion. Its effectiveness as a security measure may be enhanced by the deployment of a PIDS, a CCTV system, \nsecurity lighting and patrols by security guards. Further information on perimeter protection can be found in Chapter 11. \n \n4.8 \nAll underground access, such as rivers, drainage culverts or cables wider than 80 cm should be closed \nand/or controlled. \n \n4.9 \nAirside development should, where appropriate, provide for the following: \n \na) \nphysical security measures for the airport perimeter and security restricted areas; \n \nb) \nperimeter roadways and other access roads for patrol purposes; \n \nc) \nsecurity and apron lighting; \n \nd) \nvehicle and pedestrian access points to the airport perimeter and security restricted areas, including \nautomated access control systems; \n \ne) \nelectronic intrusion detection systems; \n \nf) \nan isolated aircraft parking position, for the searching of aircraft subject to specific threats or an act of \nunlawful seizure; \n \ng) \na blast containment area for suspect explosive devices; \n \nh) \nexplosive detection equipment for cargo containers and pallets;",

Before designing appropriate security protection and measures for \nair navigation facilities, States should conduct a comprehensive vulnerability assessment of each air navigation facility, \nas well as an impact analysis of the consequences of a light, medium, or severe disruption of service. \n \n4.14 \nThe scope of possible attacks against air navigation facilities should be listed for each facility, as well as \nthe potential consequences of such attacks on the safety and security of the public, passengers and staff, and on the \noperations of the airport. It should be noted that the objective of some attacks against air navigation facilities might only \nbe to cause major disruptions of service, so that use of the airport becomes impracticable for a certain period of time \nuntil repairs are done on any affected major air navigation aids, water or power supply, etc. The scope of modus \noperandi for such attacks is as large as the range of weapons that may be used. \n \n4.15 \nAs a general principle, a fail-safe, multilayer approach for essential air navigation aids should be developed, \nbased on a security risk assessment as well as on a cost analysis. Such a measure would ensure that a successful \nattack against the first layer would not automatically stop operations at the airport and would facilitate appropriate \nadditional protective measures at the second layer, until repairs are done on the first layer. If a multilayer approach is not \nfeasible, adequate protective measures remain essential for safety, security, and operational objectives. \n \n \nAir traffic control tower \n \n4.16 \nAir traffic control towers may be attacked by perpetrators from the exterior, using rocket-propelled grenade \nweapons or small arms fire, or from the interior, following an intrusion. Disruption of the power supply could also have \nconsequences for air traffic control tower operations. States should therefore ensure that these major threats are \naddressed at the design stage, to ensure that potential perpetrators cannot launch an attack using such weapons, or \naccess the air traffic control tower from public areas, without a timely reaction from the relevant authorities.

To maintain power supply, auxiliary generators should be installed in areas that are protected at all times. \n \n \nAir navigation aids \n \n4.17 \nAir navigation aids may be located within the airport perimeter, in close proximity to the airport or in a \nremote location. If air navigation aids are located inside the perimeter, all protective measures and equipment installed \nfor the general protection of the perimeter for safety and security reasons are a first line of defence. However, attention \nshould be given to the positioning of air navigation aids so that they are not all grouped in the same area without \nadditional protective measures and devices such as anti-intrusion systems and CCTV surveillance. \n \n4.18 \nAdditional protective measures and devices should be in place for air navigation aids located close to the \nairport, but outside the perimeter, so that potential attempted attacks or actual attacks may be immediately detected. \nThe airport perimeter may need to be adjusted to include all air navigation aids located close to the airport, if possible. \nAlternatively, the installation of surveillance equipment is recommended. \n \n4.19 \nFor remote air navigation aids, CCTV surveillance of the outside of the facility, with automatic recording, \nand frequent patrols at irregular intervals, should be implemented. \n \n \nAir navigation systems \n \n4.20 \nIdeally, the facilities hosting air navigation systems should design their own security systems in close \ncoordination with national and local appropriate authorities based on a security risk assessment. The relevant authorities \nshould perform threat and risk assessments so that vulnerabilities may be identified and appropriate countermeasures \ndeveloped and implemented. In many States, air navigation systems are privatized and/or located away from the airport, \nand attention should therefore be given to providing appropriate protective measures for such systems. \n \n \nCargo facilities \n \n4.21 \nSecurity measures are required for cargo prior to transport by air, through the application of either a \nregulated agent concept of cargo security or other appropriate security controls, which may include screening. \n \n4.22 \nOperational aspects related to cargo and security measures should be separated by dividing on-airport \ncargo facilities into two areas as follows: \n \na) \nlandside public area or building, which may be entered by cargo or mail service personnel and \nmembers of the public arriving at the facility to send or pick up goods, as well as by service, delivery or \ncollection vehicles. This area should include the spaces, loading bays, and rooms used to facilitate \ncargo delivery and pick-up. Although it forms part of the landside, access to this facility should be \ncontrolled. At a minimum, only those with documentation demonstrating that they have a need to \naccess the area, such as employee identification, air waybill of shipment and statement of delivery, \nshould be allowed access; and \n \nb) \nsecurity area or unit, which includes facilities where cargo is processed through the appropriate \nsecurity controls, which may include screening, before being transported to and/or loaded onto an",

For cargo processed by regulated agents, the controls in the security unit may be limited to \nthe verification of the documentation certifying that the shipment is covered under the regulated agent \nregime. For other cargo, the appropriate security controls comprise a large variety of technical or other \nmeans, which are intended to identify or detect explosives or other dangerous devices, articles or \nsubstances in shipments. \n \n \nCatering and mail handling facilities \n \n4.23 \nCatering and mail items should be subjected to security measures prior to transport by air, through \napplication of either a regulated agent concept or other appropriate security controls. Further guidance can be found in \nChapter 14. \n \n4.24 \nMail, express mail and goods intended for transport by air should be subjected to the same level of security \nas air cargo. The same design concept described with regard to cargo, for landside areas and security units, should \napply. \n \n \nPower supplies \n \n4.25 \nWith regard to power supplies for security equipment and control systems, States should: \n \na) \nfollow the guidance in the Aerodrome Design Manual (Doc 9157), Part 5 \u2013 Electrical Systems, with \nregard to the power supply for navigation aids, networks for aerodrome sectorals and secondary \npower supplies, the design and installation of networks, and the installation and control of \nunderground or surface power supply cables; \n \nb) \ninstall voltage regulating inverters before each item of detection equipment on those aerodromes \nsubject to large voltage fluctuations; and \n \nc) \nprovide for humidity and air temperature control in areas where detection equipment and security \ncontrol systems are located. \n \n \nWater supplies \n \n4.26 \nWater supply is essential to the safety of civil aviation operations as, given a disruption in water supply, an \nairport cannot operate until repairs are made or alternative solutions found. For design purposes, the water supply \nshould be considered as vulnerable, and emergency plans for use in the event of disruptions should be developed. \nOptions that may be considered include having more than one water supply at an airport or locating a water supply \ninside the airport perimeter to benefit from the general protection of all sensitive installations or in areas covered by \nproper security surveillance and, if possible, away from habitations, public buildings or unguarded places. \n \n \nFuel farms \n \n4.27 \nFuel farms should be situated outside the airport perimeter but close to the main access gate.

As with any other facility with \naccess to the airside, maintenance facilities should develop their own security programmes in close cooperation with the \nnational and local appropriate authorities. In addition to the usual threats posed by staff with access to the airside, or \npersons accessing the airside via maintenance facilities, there are specific threats to be considered for maintenance \noperations, such as sabotage of aircraft via maintenance operations, dangerous items placed in hidden parts of an \naircraft for future use by perpetrators, and deliberate actions to create malfunctions of aircraft equipment. \n \n \n5. \nHUMAN FACTORS AND ERGONOMICS \n \n5.1 \nAs Human Factors are increasingly important in aviation security, new facilities at airports should be \ndesigned in such a way that staff expected to operate within the facilities can do so in the most efficient and productive \nmanner. \n \n5.2 \nErgonomics, or the relationship between people and their working environment, should also be considered. \n \n5.3 \nOne of the principal objectives of Human Factors considerations in aviation security operations is to make \nthe aviation security system resilient to the consequences of human errors. \n \n5.4 \nLeveraging human capabilities and adaptabilities is a way to enhance overall system performance.

The two halves interlock when the door is closed, thereby preventing the hinged edge of the door being \nlevered away from the frame even if the hinges have been removed. \n \n1.6 \nThe security of a door depends in part on its frame, and it may be necessary to strengthen the frame and \nits attachment to the surrounding building fabric. In some circumstances, doorsteps may also need reinforcing by \nreplacing wooden sills with concrete. If frames are secured only by nails driven into brickwork they may, for greater \nsecurity, be fitted with steel supports to both sides of the frame and attached by steel brackets to the masonry. \nAlternatively, expanding bolts may be used, provided that they are set deep into the brickwork. \n \n \n \nSensitive Security Information \nDissemination, reproduction or onward distribution of this document is expressly prohibited without the consent of the originators. \n \nApp 15-1",

It is usually advisable to protect such doors with intrusion detection and \naccess control systems. Doors to basement, ground or first floor rooms may need to be kept locked. The keys to the \nlocks on such doors should be held under secure conditions but should be readily accessible to authorized persons. \n \n1.8 \nThere is often a conflict between the demands of security and those of safety when it comes to securing \nemergency exits. Most emergency exit locks, including those of the bar release type, are not fully secure, therefore \nemergency exits should be fitted with intrusion detection devices. \n \n \nWide-angle optical viewers \n \n1.9 \nIf it is necessary for a guard to be able to identify visitors without opening a door, or to inspect the interior \nof a room without entering it, wide-angle optical viewers should be fitted in preference to apertures fitted with security \nglass. The fitting of a convex mirror, for use in conjunction with such a viewer, may enable hidden spaces to be seen. \nThere should be adequate lighting to illuminate the area on the other side of the door, and guards should have access to \nthe switch. \n \n \nGrilles and shutters \n \n1.10 \nExpanding grille gates, roller grilles or roller shutters may be used in doorways, passages or other \nopenings. These may also be useful as a second layer of defence behind existing external doors, especially if there is a \nthreat of forcible attack. The frames of grilles or shutters should be secured to the surrounding structure of the building \nand, preferably, should be inaccessible from the outside of the building. Grilles are vulnerable as they permit access to \nboth sides of the lock, and this potential weakness should be borne in mind. \n \n \nWindows \n \n1.11 \nAll non-essential windows that are accessible from the landside should be bricked up or otherwise made \nsecure. All basement, ground floor and other windows that are readily accessible should have secure fittings. Dormer \nwindows are sometimes easily accessible from the roof of a building. Window catches should be examined on a regular \nbasis and defective catches replaced. Consideration should be given to providing protection by means of intrusion \ndetection systems. \n \n1.12 \nWindows overlooking security restricted areas require more protection, such as by being fitted with window \nlocks. The most vulnerable windows are usually those at basement or ground level, those near fire escapes or verandas, \nand those immediately below a roof. If it is necessary to further secure a window, the use of bars, grilles or shutters \nshould be considered. The installation of intrusion detection systems should also be considered.

Such glazing is unobtrusive, may draw less attention to a sensitive area and is aesthetically more \nacceptable than bars or grilles. Double-glazing can be equipped with an alarm and has the further advantage of thermal \ninsulation and noise reduction. \n \n1.15 \nCare should be taken with all glazing to ensure that the glazing bead or the material used to secure the \nglazing material to the window frame is not accessible from the outside and therefore vulnerable to a surreptitious attack. \n \n \nRoofs and roof doors \n \n1.16 \nRoofs should be surveyed to see whether there is access to them from adjoining or nearby buildings, attic \nor roof spaces, chimneys, fire escapes, window cleaning equipment, trees, etc. If so, it may be necessary to install \nsuitable grilles or barriers. If access is necessary, for example as part of a fire escape route, intrusion detection systems \nmay be required. \n \n1.17 \nIf a roof is accessible from neighbouring buildings or from the ground via roof access doors, they should be \nsecured in the same way as other external doors. If doors provide emergency escape routes for the occupants of \nneighbouring buildings, suitable exit and intrusion detection devices should be fitted on the doors. \n \n \nSkylights, fanlights and roof lights \n \n1.18 \nSkylights, fanlights and roof lights should be secured with locks or bolts. If more protection is needed, \nhowever, one of the following measures should be considered: \n \na) \nreplacing the glass with security glazing material; \n \nb) \nfitting grilles or bars; \n \nc) \nscrewing the frames in place and covering the glass with steel mesh secured to the frame on the \ninside; or \n \nd) \ninstalling intrusion detection devices. \n \n \nExternal drainage pipes \n \n1.19 \nAccess to the upper floors of a building or to the roof may often be afforded by way of rainwater drainage \npipes.

Outside working hours, \nthey should be closed with roller shutters or sliding shutters secured on the inside.

Therefore, it is important that protective \nsecurity measures be regularly reviewed in the context of such trends. \n \n2.4 \nFor the physical protection of the front of an installation, two contradictory objectives should be achieved. \nOn the one hand, protection should be hard enough to protect against direct attacks, such as from vehicles trying to \npenetrate the terminal or explosives placed in front of a terminal building. On the other hand, protection should be soft in \norder to avoid projectiles of glass or concrete reaching persons inside the terminal building and causing injuries or death. \n \n2.5 \nThe use of materials that are resistant to the effects of weapon discharges and explosive blasts is a key \nfactor when designing airport facilities with security in mind. In addition, the use of materials that are fire resistant and do \nnot give off toxic smoke or fumes when set alight is highly recommended. \n \n2.6 \nWhen fitting out the public areas of a terminal, materials should be used that will, in the event of an \nexplosion, fail in such a way as to minimize the formation of secondary fragments and thus reduce casualties and \ndamage. The following actions should be taken: \n \na) \navoid brittle materials such as glass or rigid plastics that can break into sharp fragments; \n \nb) \nuse materials that are flexible and strong (e.g. polycarbonate, metal sheets and toughened glass), \nductile (e.g. metal sheets and laminated glass) or weak and soft (e.g. plasterboard, hardboard, wood \nwool and foam-filled sandwiches); \n \nc) \nprovide appropriately strong fixings, ideally with the same resistance capacity as the material being \nsecured. This may mean recommending that inner sheets away from a blast be screwed rather than \nnailed or screwed through additional surface plates or battens to prevent screws being torn out; and \n \nd) \nminimize opportunities for the collapse of light structures, such as by designing booths, concessionary \naccommodation, etc., to resist blast loads, even though they are in the sheltered concourse. \n \n2.7 \nIn designing terminal building landside areas, special security consideration should be given to the \nfollowing: \n \na) \nroad layout; \n \nb) \naccess control posts; \n \nc) \nparking areas; \n \nd) \nlandscaping and boundaries; \n \ne) \nterminal forecourts; \n \nf) \nlighting and signage;",

There is the effect of the initial explosion to \nconsider, as well as the consequential effects should parts of the structure collapse. In this regard, two solutions may be \nconsidered: \n \na) \nblast deflector, which could also be useful for hard protection, placed in a such way as to deflect the \nblast and pressure wave from an explosion; or \n \nb) \nplastic film placed on the glass, which helps reduce the shattering of glass, which in turn reduces the \nshrapnel risk to persons. \n \n2.9 \nIn larger terminal buildings, the use of glass, particularly in public forecourts close to ground transportation \nsystems, should be restricted because of the potential shrapnel effect. Buildings should be designed with a heavy roof \nand thick walls, and windows should be kept to a minimum. Floors and supporting structures in multi-storey buildings \nshould be reinforced to prevent or alleviate pancaking. \n \n2.10 \nThe number and dimensions of windows should also be kept to a minimum in order to minimize the effects \nof an explosion. Aesthetically designed bomb blast net curtains may be used over windows and glazing to contain glass \nshrapnel in the event of an explosion. Key facilities and passenger processes should be located away from the sides of \nthe building. Critical utility systems, such as electricity and gas, should have alternative supply inputs, and the control \nboxes should be dispersed so that a single blast will not render the whole system unusable. \n \n2.11 \nBarriers, such as low height bollards or in landscaping, such as through the strategic placement of \nflowerpots or tree containers, should be used to prevent vehicles from approaching a terminal other than by the \nauthorized road. Drop-arm barriers, speed bumps and chicanes are some examples of how the speed of vehicles can be \ncontrolled in the vicinity of a terminal. Parking areas should be located at a distance from the terminal building so as to \nminimize the effects of bombs or vehicle borne IEDs. Controlled entry points to parking areas should be provided. \n \n2.12 \nVehicle-proof barricades on pavements and sidewalks outside buildings can prevent vehicle borne IEDs \nfrom crashing into a building. CCTVs, monitored 24 hours per day, that record events on the outside and periphery of a \nbuilding deter reconnaissance by would-be attackers. A vehicle registration recognition system may be used to check \nvehicles against a database of lost or stolen vehicles. Trash bins should be designed to either restrict the placing of \nbulky items and/or facilitate easy inspection. \n \n \nTerminal glazing \n \n2.13 \nAn explosive device detonated within or near an airport terminal may result in widespread injuries and \ncause extensive damage, especially to glazing. While some terminal designs minimize the use of glazing on outer \nsurfaces, most generally incorporate the maximum use of such glazing, so it is essential to understand the failure \nmechanisms of glass types. While it is usually not practical to undertake substantial re-glazing of existing facilities, there \nare a variety of steps that may be taken to reduce the risk of injury caused by flying glass, for example, the application of \ntransparent polyester anti-shatter film to the glass and/or provision of bomb blast net curtains.",

Such glass breaks into \ndangerous sharp shards that can be forcibly blown by the blast and inflict severe injuries; \n \nb) \ntoughened or tempered glass is stronger and offers about twice the level of protection of plain glass. \nSuch glass contains locked in stresses so that when it does break, it explodes into many small cuboid \nfragments, which are less injurious than plain glass shards; and \n \nc) \nlaminated glass comprises a sandwich of, generally, two layers of glass separated by an adhesive \nlayer of polyvinylbutyl. The glass cracks at similar pressures to that of plain glass. However, the \npolyvinylbutyl interlayer acts as a membrane that can resist much larger pressures, if the laminated \nglass is well fixed into its frame. The enhancement in the level of protection that is offered by 7.5 mm \nthick laminated glass is three times that provided by annealed glass. \n \n2.15 \nThe implications of the above failure mechanisms, when comparing toughened and laminated glass, are that: \n \na) \ntoughened glass is significantly better at resisting accidental local impact, such as knocks from \ntrolleys, without cracking; \n \nb) \nthe rigidity of the glass frame is critical to the failure point of toughened glass; \n \nc) \nat fairly distant charge-stand-off ranges at which toughened glass will resist damage, laminated glass \nwill crack but not rupture; \n \nd) \nat intermediate ranges, toughened glass will disintegrate, allowing the blast wave to pass through, \ncarrying cuboid fragments of glass, whereas laminated glass will yield but not rupture and offer \ncomplete protection; \n \ne) \nfor a given explosive charge, laminated glass will crack and require replacement over a far wider area; \nand \n \nf) \nthe ultimate strength of the glass frame, even if deflected, and the strength and depth of rebate fixing, \nare critical to the failure point of laminated glass. This becomes more critical in the case of a large \ncharge that is capable of blowing the whole pane in bodily if it can be pulled out of its rebate before \nrupture of the PVB interlayer occurs. \n \n2.16 \nIn the final analysis, the differences come down to: \n \na) \nthe fact that for a given charge threat there will always be a critical band width of stand-off ranges \nwithin which laminated glass can provide greater safety than toughened glass; and \n \nb) \nwhether or not the band width of ranges is sufficient for its safety advantages to outweigh other \nconsiderations. \n \n2.17 \nIn the above analysis, the following should be considered:",
  "645": "Appendix 15 Access control and terminal protection \nApp 15-9 \nSensitive Security Information \nDissemination, reproduction or onward distribution of this document is expressly prohibited without the consent of the originators. \n \n \n \n \na) \nthe precise width of the band is blurred by uncertainties of the surrounding frame and rebate \neffectiveness, as well as glazing test extrapolations; \n \nb) \nuncertainties over the actual size of the threat, as well as its location; and \n \nc) \nthe fact that, at and below the close end of the band: \n \n1) \ntoughened glass fragments can approach lethal velocities; and \n \n2) \nthere is the risk that laminated panes will blow in en masse with larger charges. \n \n2.18 \nAt ranges within about 4 m, windows made of each of the glazing options will blow out if a bomb containing \n5 kg of high explosives is detonated and fatalities could occur from direct blast effects. At ranges of up to about 12 m, an \ninner float glass pane could rebound into the concourse, showering people with sharp glass, whereby laceration injuries \ncould be inflicted on those who might otherwise have escaped a direct blast, notwithstanding the risk of eardrum rupture. \nSimilar injuries could be inflicted on persons on the other side of the float glass. Float glass should therefore be avoided \nin either situation. \n \n2.19 \nA window might resist, without rupture, a bomb containing 5 kg of high explosives, through the use of, \nassuming rigid frames in both cases, either double-glazed: \n \na) \nlaminate, at about a 5 m range; or \n \nb) \ntoughened glass at about an 8.5 m range. \n \n2.20 \nLaminated toughened glass combines the advantages of toughened glass and laminated annealed glass. \nThe following properties of such glass may be deduced: \n \na) \nit will crack at similar pressures to toughened glass of the same overall thickness, i.e. higher than \neither annealed or laminated annealed glass; and \n \nb) \nfrom first crack to final rupture, it is likely to behave in a similar fashion to laminated annealed glass. \n \n2.21 \nAs with toughened glass, the radius of damage from a charge will be less than for laminated annealed \nglass, and laminated toughened glass will resist complete rupture as will laminated annealed glass at ranges at which \ntoughened glass will disintegrate. It is possible that laminated toughened glass has two further advantages: \n \na) \nalthough its strength, as for any sandwich material, is theoretically less than a single layer of \ntoughened glass of the same overall thickness, it is likely to be more flexible. Thus, it may tolerate \nhigher pressures, i.e. lower charge ranges, to first crack, particularly where failure is governed by the \ndeflection of the support frame; and \n \nb) \nin double-glazed form, its initial resistance, up to first crack, may result in sufficient reflection of early \npeak blast pressures to enhance the resistance of the inner pane to both first crack and final rupture. \n \n2.22 \nIt is essential to calculate the structural limitations of the framing. The collapse risk of the mullions and the \ndeflection failure limit of the transoms and mullions all require calculation. The possible survival of selected glazing also \ndepends on strong edge restraints and adequate rebate depth.",

For windows over 3 m2 in area or if the glass is over 6 mm thick, \n175-micron film should be used, as well as if bomb blast net curtains have not been installed. The use of 300-micron film \nshould be considered for windows over 10 m2 in area, and for ground-floor windows over 3 m2 in area if bomb blast net \ncurtains have not been installed. \n \n2.25 \nFor new windows, or those being reglazed, the new glass should preferably be treated before fixing the \nframes, with the film completely covering the glass to its extreme edges. The decision to apply film before glazing should \nbe weighed in the context of contract and site conditions, as other work, renovations, dust, etc., may cause \nunacceptable scratching. \n \n2.26 \nOn existing windows, film should be applied as closely as possible to the putty glazing bars, with an edge \ngap of less than 3 mm. However, edge gaps up to 5 mm may have to be tolerated along particularly irregular and old \nputty edges. Film should only be fixed under clean and dust-free conditions and, while it cannot be applied to the \npatterned side of frosted, figured or receded glass, consideration may be given to reversing the glass. If the film is \ninsufficiently wide to cover the glass in one piece, a butt joint is acceptable. \n \n2.27 \nThe proper application of anti-shatter film to double-glazed windows depends on the type of window \nconcerned. If the window consists of two separate frames and, in normal use, the inner frame can be opened \nindependently of the outer, both panes should be treated with film on the room side of the glass. If the inner pane cannot \nbe independently opened or sealed unit double-glazing is fitted, it is normally adequate for only the inner pane to be \ntreated. It should be noted that the inner pane of some double-glazing systems is only lightly fixed, and if this is the case, \nsuch panes should be secured. \n \n2.28 \nA peel adhesion strength test should be performed for the on-site quality control of film installation and also \nfor checking whether any degradation of performance has taken place during its service life. \n \n \nBomb blast net curtains \n \n2.29 \nBomb blast net curtains should be of 90 to 100 denier polyester Terylene curtain material and be twice the \nwidth and one-and-a-half times the length of the window. The bottom hem should incorporate flexible weights at the rate \nof 400 grams per metre. The excess length should be folded concertina-style and placed in shallow troughs at windowsill \nlevel. Such curtains should not be used without anti-shatter film being applied to the window.",

Under slightly more extreme blast conditions, the curtains break away from the top fixings and, at the \nsame time, billow outwards freely, up the sides, front and bottom, wrapping the glass and depositing it on the floor near \nthe window. Under even more extreme blast conditions, the curtains, as well as arresting stray fragments of glass, \nremain capable of wrapping around small- and medium-sized panes, causing them to drop closer to the window and \ntherefore cause less hazard than if curtains were not used. \n \n2.32 \nThe installation of bomb blast net curtains is vital for windows with small panes. \n \n \nPassenger terminal buildings \n \n2.33 \nThe following principles should be the basis for security and operational planning for passenger terminal \nbuildings: \n \na) \npassenger and baggage flow routes should be simple and self-evident; \n \nb) \ntransfer and transit passenger flows should be physically separated, preferably in both domestic and \ninternational operations; \n \nc) \nthe number of security checkpoints should be minimized. This can be achieved by centralizing the \nscreening checkpoints at an area where the passenger and baggage flow routes converge; \n \nd) \nthe number of points from which persons can access the airside area, and particularly security \nrestricted areas, should be minimized; and \n \ne) \nall passenger departure areas between screening checkpoints and aircraft should be considered \nsecurity restricted areas into which access should be controlled. \n \n2.34 \nThe following considerations should be given to any landside public viewing terraces or areas that overlook \naircraft parked on the apron or passenger handling operations: \n \na) \naccess should be controlled or the areas supervised by guards; \n \nb) \nthe areas should be enclosed or contain barriers to prevent unauthorized access or the throwing of \nobjects into security restricted areas or at parked aircraft; and \n \nc) \naccess control features should enable the areas to be secured and closed to the public when required.",

Optimum safety aims at enabling people to be evacuated in the event of danger, while security aims at \ncontrolling people\u2019s movements and limiting their access to certain areas. Reconciliation of these objectives should be \nbased on determining a preferred airside-to-landside evacuation direction. Each airport area should be the subject of a \nspecific evacuation plan to ensure that security is not compromised. \n \n2.39 \nEvacuation from the airside to the landside is preferred, and every effort should be made to keep the \nnumber of emergency exits and points of passage to the minimum required for safety reasons. Evacuation should only \nbe done towards the airside area if architectural constraints or the length of the evacuation routes so require. In any \nevent, all emergency exits on the airside should be secured. \n \n2.40 \nThe number of entrances and exits to the terminal along the curb should be kept to the minimum \ncompatible with smooth traffic flow. Such entrances and exits should be equipped with a master locking system, which \nwill allow the simultaneous locking of all doors in an emergency. \n \n2.41 \nSigns should be installed along the curb indicating that parking is limited to the time needed to offload \npassengers. Positions reserved for private vehicles should be separated from those reserved for buses and taxis. Bus \nand taxi parking positions should be placed away from manoeuvring lanes to permit them to load and offload \npassengers along the curb. \n \n2.42 \nIf the airport is served by rail, outdoor or underground stations should preferably be located away from the \nterminal building and be accessed by pedestrian walkways. \n \n2.43 \nIn planning and designing terminal buildings, provision should be made for the installation of the following \nairport security features: \n \na) \nhold baggage screening checkpoints; \n \nb) \npassenger and cabin baggage screening checkpoints; \n \nc) \nflight and cabin crew screening checkpoints;",

Notably, despite the term automated, \nan automated access control system still requires a measure of human supervision. \n \n \nTypes of automated access control systems \n \n2.46 \nIdentification systems used widely in a commercial automated access control system include a coded card \nused with or without a personal identification number or with biometrics. The two types of systems that are commonly \nused are: \n \na) \nonline system, linked to a number of controlled entrances that are centrally programmed and managed \nfrom a central control unit or computer; and \n \nb) \noffline system, with a stand-alone unit working independently of other entrances from its own local \ncontrol unit. \n \n2.47 \nAn automated access control system used without a personal identification number only recognizes the \ncard, not the person using it. The security of a system is enhanced if the card is used with a personal identification \nnumber. A system using a coded card with a personal identification number comprises a card reader with a keypad at \neach entrance, a local control unit, a central control unit or computer, and a locking unit and barrier. A personal \nidentification number should be a random number that is at least four digits long and should be allocated by the system \nmanager and not chosen by individuals. \n \n2.48 \nAn automated access control system coded card is usually of credit card size and made of plastic, \nalthough other cards and tokens of various sizes and shapes may also be used. Cards should have a design or logo \nprinted on them and should include a photograph. If a coded card is used in an airport security identification permit \nsystem, the requirements for permit design and renewal should apply.",

Cards may be coded using one of several technologies, including barium ferrite, holography, Hollerith inductive \nmagnetic strip, infrared bar code, punched card, radio signal responder, watermark magnetic strip and Wiegand wire. \n \n2.50 \nVarious types of card readers are available depending on the card coding technology used and the \nenvironment in which the reader is required to work. Generally, two readers should be used at each door, one with a \nkeypad for entering the controlled area and one without a keypad for exiting. This arrangement allows the system to \nmonitor and record all entrances and exits, enforce anti-pass-back and maintain a register of everyone in the controlled \narea. \n \n2.51 \nAll card readers should be connected to a local control unit. When the user inserts a card into the card \nreader and keys in the personal identification number, the local control unit verifies the data with those held in its \ndatabase and allows entry by releasing the electric lock of the entry and exit barrier. In an online system, the local \ncontrol unit sends the entry information to the central control unit to be recorded and passed on to all other local control \nunits in the system. This process is known as distributed intelligence, in that all access decisions are made at the local \ncontrol unit, and the central control unit acts as a system manager and archive store. \n \n2.52 \nA barrier can be a door, turnstile or booth, and is an integral part of any automated access control system. \nIn a security restricted area installation, barriers should be full height and fitted so that there is no space between them \nand the ceiling or the adjoining walls and partitions. They should be designed to restrict entry to one person at a time. \nExtra precautions such as metal detectors or weight sensors may be incorporated into an automated access control \nsystem barrier. At main entrances, the most effective barriers able to cope with large numbers of users are turnstiles, \neither of metal bar spokes or of polycarbonate sheets. \n \n2.53 \nAn automated access control system may be used in conjunction with a conventional door, for example, to \nrestrict access to a room or suite inside a building, but such use may raise security problems. The level of security \nprovided depends on the security of the door. A door is more vulnerable to being circumvented, particularly by tailgating, \nthan a properly designed barrier. Therefore, a strong adjustable door closer should be fitted. \n \n \nSystem selection considerations \n \n2.54 \nAn automated access control system, installed for controlling access to a security restricted area, should \nbe: \n \na) \nprovided with a standby source of power; \n \nb) \nequipped with a fail lock that locks automatically in the event of a power failure or other emergency, so \nthat the area to which the system is controlling access remains secured; \n \nc) \nfitted with a mechanical override on the secure side of the barrier to permit exit in an emergency when \nthe system is locked, as in b); \n \nd) \nfitted with security locks for use outside working hours; \n \ne) \nproof against manipulation and tampering, for example, the wiring may need special protection; \n \nf) \nequipped with an alarm facility for signalling failure or abuse of the system;",

The maximum number of \nunsuccessful attempts permitted should not generally be greater than three. \n \n \nHands-free automated access control systems \n \n2.55 \nWith a hands-free or radio type automated access control system, a plastic card or token responds to the \ndoor interrogation unit by transmitting a unique coded signal. This signal is received by the door unit and checked by the \nautomated access control system. If the signal is accepted, the door lock is released. \n \n2.56 \nThis type of system has the advantage of being hands-free but has several disadvantages in security \nterms. The coded signal can be recorded and a duplicate token made, or a spurious signal may activate the lock. For \nthese reasons, hands-free systems should always be used with a personal identification number in security restricted \narea installations. \n \n2.57 \nHands-free systems can operate over short or long distances. A short-range proximity card or token needs \nto be positioned within about one metre of the door unit before it will operate the automated access control system. A \nlong-range system, which operates over several metres, has cards with a long-life battery within, and is referred to as an \nactive card system. Users should be aware that, because of its ability to transmit independently of the automated access \ncontrol system, there is a potential security risk that an active hands-free system might act as a radio microphone. \n \n \nBiometric automated access control systems \n \n2.58 \nA biometric automated access control system verifies a user\u2019s identity by checking a physiological feature \noffered at the point of entry against the record of the same feature held in a database. Such systems include those \nbased on signatures or the following physiological characteristics: fingerprints, hand geometry, eye retina scan, hand \nvein patterns and voice recognition. \n \n2.59 \nThe main advantage of a biometric automated access control system is that it verifies the identity of the \nperson requesting access while other systems only verify the card (which may be lost, forged or stolen) and the personal \nidentification number (which may be divulged by the user or compromised). Fraudulent use of a given physiological \nfeature is virtually impossible without the active cooperation of the authorized user. \n \n2.60 \nA biometric automated access control system tends to be expensive, usually takes longer to operate and \ncan be user intrusive. Such systems need to be adjusted to a high level of sensitivity in order to prevent unauthorized \naccess. Further, the use of a biometric system may prove challenging for users with certain physiological impairments. \n \n \nAdministration of an automated access control system \n \n2.61 \nAn automated access control system can provide a cost-effective and reliable method of controlling access \nto a security restricted area, but careful supervision and dedicated management and support staff should be provided if \nsecurity is to be maintained.

  "653": "Appendix 16 \nPASSENGER SCREENING FACILITIES \n \nGENERAL \n \n1.1 \nThe first step in designing passenger screening facilities is to understand some basic design criteria \ndeveloped by terminal building designers and use the same criteria for developing optimized and sustainable security \nsystems. Security systems comprise human resources, equipment and infrastructure or layout, and proper dimensioning \nand layout are essential to the overall effectiveness of the system. Facilitation, Human Factors and sustainability should \nbe considered along with technical measures and detection capabilities. Through detailed planning and careful \nconsideration of the security, facilitation, Human Factors and operational requirements, it should be possible to optimize \nthe passenger screening process in terms of efficiency, effectiveness and service to passengers. The question is \nwhether security preventive measures should always be imposed on airport and aircraft operator operations, regardless \nof their implications and consequences, or whether a better security system could be developed. \n \n1.2 \nAssumptions related to the operation of a passenger screening facility should be verified against \nperformance data obtained from comparable operations elsewhere. This is particularly important with assumptions \nrelating to throughput, alarm rates and processing times for different manual procedures or equipment. \n \n1.3 \nIATA\u2019s Airport Development Reference Manual (ADRM) provides detailed guidance on the planning of \nterminal facilities and sets recommended design parameters for different processes, including the following average \nprocessing times: \n \na) \nfor check-in, at 150 seconds per passenger; \n \nb) \nat departure passport control, at 15 seconds per passenger; and \n \nc) \nfor security screening, at 12 seconds per passenger. \n \n1.4 \nHowever, these parameters are a guide and do not consider the queuing time before each process. \nSpecific design parameters should be based on detailed operational analysis of: the flows and typology of the traffic \nexisting at an airport; the level of service set; planned facility improvements; and the forecast of traffic expected for the \nnext 10 to 15 years. \n \n1.5 \nThe Level of Service standard is a parameter used in the Airport Development Reference Manual (ADRM) \nto plan space requirements for passengers in a terminal. A Level of Service standard of A is the highest and allows for \nmore space per passenger than a Level of Service standard of E, which is the lowest and provides the least space. \n \n1.6 \nThe departure facilitation process may be seen as a flow, with the objective of planning to optimize the flow, \nor throughput, of passengers. Within the flow, different security and border control processes take place, and the output \nrate from one process may dictate the input rate for the next. Accordingly, planners should look at not only individual \nprocesses but also their impact on the overall flow. \n \n \nSensitive Security Information \nDissemination, reproduction or onward distribution of this document is expressly prohibited without the consent of the originators. \n \nApp 16-1",
  "654": "App 16-2 \nAviation Security Manual \nSensitive Security Information \nDissemination, reproduction or onward distribution of this document is expressly prohibited without the consent of the originators. \n \n \n \n \nPassport controls at departure \n \n1.7 \nIf passport control processes take place before the security screening process, the passenger throughput \nrate at passport control will likely determine the turn up or input rate of passengers at security screening. Inadequate \nchannels or staffing of these processes will lead to long queues, which are neither beneficial from a service perspective \nnor from a security perspective, as the queues may present a target for perpetrators. If the processing rate of \npassengers at security screening does not match that at passport control, a queue will likely form between the two \nlocations. If action is not taken to relieve congestion in the security screening area, the queue may extend to the \npassport control area and cause passport inspection to be suspended. Planners and terminal managers should achieve \na balance in terms of both capacity and real-time passenger throughput. \n \n1.8 \nQueues in passport control screening areas should be kept as short as possible by ensuring that sufficient \ncounters are provided and staffed, that passengers are properly sorted in the queue process and, where possible, using \nautomated passenger clearance methods enabled by machine-readable travel documents, e-passports or special \nidentity cards. Such analysis should preferably be outsourced for fairness and accuracy purposes. \n \n \nPositioning of passenger screening checkpoints \n \n1.9 \nThere are three typical layout arrangements for the screening of passengers and cabin baggage, as shown \nin Figure A16-1, referred to as: \n \na) \ndecentralized or boarding gate screening, which takes place at boarding gates and typically has \nscreening channels serving one to two boarding gates each; \n \nb) \nsemi-centralized or concourse screening, where screening takes place at the entrance to a concourse \nserving a number of gates and is typically positioned after the main duty-free shop area; and \n \nc) \ncentralized screening, which takes place at the entrance point to security restricted areas, either \nbefore or after passport control, and typically before the main duty-free shop area. \n \n \nDetermining screening facility requirements \n \n1.10 \nMethodologies used to conduct capacity and level-of-service assessments may be general or detailed in \nnature depending on the issues being evaluated. However, a mathematical approach using simplified formulas may \nprovide an overall view of the capacity of existing facilities and of facilities required to handle a given throughput of \npassengers. \n \n1.11 \nThe IATA formula uses a 10-minute reference period within a peak hour, since passenger flows may \nfluctuate during a peak hour period due to an uneven distribution of passengers arriving at an airport. It should be noted \nthat other periods within a peak hour, such as a 15- or 20-minute period, could also be used for analysis. \n \n1.12 \nThe first piece of information to be considered is the passenger demand level, which is the number of \npassengers exiting a check-in area over the reference period. The passenger throughput, shown in the formula below, is \na function of the number of check-in counters in operation during the reference period, the average processing time at \ncheck-in in seconds and the percentage of passengers using e-ticketing, off-airport check-in or common use self-service.",
  "655": "Appendix 16 Passenger screening facilities \nApp 16-3 \nSensitive Security Information \nDissemination, reproduction or onward distribution of this document is expressly prohibited without the consent of the originators. \n \n \n \nThe number of such passengers affect passenger throughput and should be added to the formula to obtain a total \npassenger demand level. \n \nPassenger throughput = 600 (10 minutes * 60 seconds) * number of counters / average processing time \n(for a 10-minute period) \n \n1.13 \nFollowing this determination, consideration should be given to whether local airport staff use passenger \nscreening checkpoints or have dedicated staff screening checkpoints. If airport staff use passenger screening \ncheckpoints, the passenger throughput for staff should be calculated over the same 10-minute reference period and \nadded to the passenger demand level. If local staff use separate, dedicated facilities, the same formula may be used for \nstaff screening checkpoints. The following example illustrates how this calculation is made. \n \na) \nif 45 of 60 check-in counters are in operation, passenger demand is 600 * 45 (active check-in \ncounters) / 150 (average processing time) = 180 passengers; and \n \nb) \nthe maximum passenger throughput for design purposes is 600 * 60 / 150 = 240 passengers for the \n10-minute reference period and 240 * 6 = 1 440 passengers per hour for a peak hour. \n \n1.14 \nIf passenger demand levels are known, it is possible to calculate the number of security positions required \nto meet the demand. The following shows the formula for this calculation: \n \nNumber of security positions = passenger throughput * average processing time / 600 \n(for a 10-minute period) \n \n \n \nFigure A16-1. \nPositioning of passenger screening checkpoints",
  "656": "App 16-4 \nAviation Security Manual \nSensitive Security Information \nDissemination, reproduction or onward distribution of this document is expressly prohibited without the consent of the originators. \n \n \n \n \n1.15 \nFor example, given an operational passenger throughput of 180 passengers, the number of security \nscreening positions required during the reference period are 180 (passenger throughput) * 12 (average processing time \nin seconds) / 600 = 3.6, rounded up to four security positions. \n \n1.16 \nIf the number of security screening positions in operation is known, it is possible to calculate the queuing \ntime in minutes and the number of passengers queuing. The following formulas can be used to calculate the queuing \ntime and the number of passengers queuing: \n \n \nQueuing time = passenger throughput * average processing time / (number of checks * 60) \n(for a 10-minute period) \n \n \nNumber of queuing passengers = maximum queuing time * passenger throughput / 10 \n(for a 10-minute period) \n \n1.17 \nFor example, for security the operational maximum queuing time is 180 * 12 / (4 * 60) = 9 minutes, and the \nnumber of passengers queuing is 9 * 180 / 10 = 162 passengers. Maximum queuing time is 240 * 12 / (5 * 60) = 9.6 \nminutes, and the maximum number of queuing passengers is 9.6 * 240 / 10 = 230.4, or 231 passengers. \n \n1.18 \nFinally, when the maximum number of security screening checkpoints required and the maximum number \nof passengers queuing in front of the checkpoint is known, it is possible to estimate the maximum surface area required \nto conduct security screening in optimum conditions. The area required is a function of the average area required per \npassenger times the number of passengers queuing. The formulas for both single and multiple queues are identified \nbelow: \n \nSingle queue = maximum number of queuing passengers * level of service standard area \n(divided into five possible sizes, as follows: A = 1.4 m2; B = 1.2 m2; C = 1 m2; D = 0.8 m2; and E = 0.6 m2) \n \n \nMultiple queues = maximum number of queuing passengers * 0.9 metres \n \n \nFluctuations in figures \n \n1.19 \nIt should be noted that small fluctuations in hypothetical figures have a notable impact on the end results. \nFor this reason, planners should understand the various operating characteristics for the airport being studied. National, \nregional and local travelling habits of passengers and persons accompanying passengers will have an impact on design \nof the various processing facilities and waiting areas. \n \n1.20 \nOther elements to be taken into account are as follows: \n \na) \nthe number of passengers using e-ticketing, off-airport check-in or common use self service may not \nbe included in the above formulas as such passengers do not use check-in counters. The maximum \npassenger throughput should therefore be adjusted accordingly; and",

Such a situation might create more congestion and more pressure on \nthe number of passengers queuing and on queuing time as the peak demand will be reached more \nfrequently. \n \n \nFlexibility in screening checkpoint use \n \n1.21 \nAny dedicated staff screening checkpoint should be located in the vicinity of passenger screening \ncheckpoints, in order that it may also be used for different categories of passengers and to augment normal passenger \nflow in the event that the flow of staff is low. A dedicated staff screening checkpoint may also be used by high \ncontribution passengers and those: \n \na) \nrequiring assistance, such as those in wheelchairs; \n \nb) \nregistered with a biometric programme; \n \nc) \nhaving checked-in late; and \n \nd) \nwho are unaccompanied minors. \n \n \nPassenger screening checkpoint design \n \n1.22 \nThe overall philosophy for passenger screening checkpoint design should be the same as for the hold \nbaggage screening process, with multiple levels of equipment that have different throughput and detection capabilities, \nto increase detection probability, together with the objective of speeding up the process by isolating suspect baggage \nfrom the normal flow of cleared baggage. For passenger processing, this translates to designing passenger screening \ncheckpoints that incorporate the multiple level concept with different types of detection equipment, together with the \nobjective of maintaining the best throughput possible by isolating selected passengers from the normal flow of \npassengers. This concept may be simplified as follows: \n \na) \nLevel 1, featuring conventional WTMDs designed to detect category I dangerous items listed in the \nProhibited Items List (see Appendix 43); \n \nb) \nLevel 2, featuring advanced metal and explosive substance detectors, designed to detect category II \nand III dangerous items listed in the Prohibited Items List (see Appendix 43); and \n \nc) \nLevel 3, where full body manual searches are conducted. \n \n \nSpace requirements for passenger screening checkpoints \n \n1.23 \nSpace requirements for each level of passenger screening checkpoint depend on the area required to \naccommodate the normal flow of passengers, manual search areas and equipment, as well as manual search areas for \ncabin baggage. Further guidance on common aviation security equipment can be found in Appendix 20. \n \n1.24 \nSome essential points that should be considered in designing a passenger screening checkpoint are as \nfollows:",

Many viable solutions are possible, such as one centralized \ncheck-in area or multiple check-in areas, but only a few are adaptable to terminals; \n \nb) \nmaximum passenger throughput of each check-in area, both actual and projected, as this will \ndetermine the number of passenger screening checkpoints required to absorb the flows with a \nsufficient level of service; \n \nc) \npositioning of the passport control area, if applicable, before or after security, as this might impact on \nthe security of passenger throughput; \n \nd) \nadvantages and disadvantages of centralized, semi-centralized and decentralized passenger \nscreening checkpoints in terms of space and operational constraints at each airport, considering that \nmixed options are also possible, such as centralized screening for all passengers plus a decentralized \nscreening checkpoint for flights under an increased threat; \n \ne) \ntypes of passengers, such as diplomatic, business, group, registered, or those with e-tickets or \nrequiring assistance, as background information available on known passengers may assist in \nconducting threat analysis for each category; \n \nf) \nflows of airport staff to be screened when entering the security sterile area, whether mixed with or \nseparated from the passenger flow, as some dedicated resources for staff screening checkpoints \ncould also be used for screening some categories of passengers during peak periods; \n \ng) \npolicies regarding aviation security screening, such as on the latest technology, long-term security \npolicies and cost-effective solutions, since some options might require more space in the event of \nfrequent upgrades of equipment; and \n \nh) \nresources available for staffing levels, recurring costs and investments, to assist decisions regarding \nwhether equipment-based solutions are more suitable than human-based solutions. \n \n1.25 \nGiven that space is an issue in terminal buildings, an in-depth analysis should be conducted of the \nusefulness of all offices, shops and other installations existing in or around the passenger screening checkpoint area. \nFor example, it may not be necessary to have the main aviation security office close to passenger screening checkpoints \nor even within a terminal building. Moreover, if the main office is visited by other parties and staff throughout the day, this \nmight create additional queues within the security processing area and be a distraction to security staff. The more the \npassenger screening checkpoint area is dedicated solely to security screening, the more efficient the resulting security \noperations will be. \n \n1.26 \nIn positioning security equipment in each passenger screening checkpoint, the unobstructed flow of \npassengers should be considered and complicated circuits that might affect the average processing time for passengers \nshould be avoided. The examples given in Table A16-1 are provided for guidance purposes only. \n \nBudgetary considerations \n \n1.27 \nThe costs of the entire life-cycle of a screening checkpoint should be taken into consideration when \nevaluating which screening option is most appropriate for a particular location and application at an airport. This \nconsideration should include capital costs of facilities and equipment, recurrent operating costs such as for staff and \nutilities, and maintenance costs over the equipment life-cycle.",

  "669": "Appendix 17 \n \nEMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS AND CRISIS MANAGEMENT \n \n \n1. \nGENERAL \n \nEmergency preparedness and crisis management are two essential elements of the overall security system at an airport \nsince emergencies can have serious consequences for the image and reputation of a State and the concerned airport(s). \nIn addition to the development of programmes and measures designed specifically for emergency preparedness and \ncrisis management, guidance on which can be found in Chapter 17, appropriate facilities and infrastructures need to be \navailable for the successful outcome of a crisis. Specialists and experts to be involved in the resolution of an airport \ncrisis should be consulted at the airport design stage so that their technical and operational requirements can be \nincorporated into the layout of the airport. The appropriate authority should also be consulted to ensure proper \ncoordination. \n \n \n \n2. \nEMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTRE (EOC) \n \n2.1 \nAn airport EOC should provide a focal point for those concerned with an emergency to act together in a \nsmooth, concerted way. While all EOCs should be equipped according to a basic minimum inventory, the degree of \nsophistication and the quality of each item should be in direct relationship to the size of the airport and its operations. In \nmany airports, the investment for an EOC is neglected because of the very small probability of occurrence of a major \ncrisis, and it is assumed that existing facilities could accommodate a crisis without major inconvenience. It is recognized \nthat at smaller airports it may not be possible to justify construction of a facility that meets all the recommendations \nbelow. It might be advantageous to collocate an EOC with a security operations centre or airport operational control \ncentre. Some airports operate one integrated airport control centre which coordinates and controls all the terminal, \nsecurity ramp and airfield operations. \n \n2.2 \nNotwithstanding the above, it is advisable for an EOC not to serve other functions such as a conference \nroom, as far as practicable during times of normal operations, since an EOC should always be available and on standby. \nIf an EOC is considered only at the last stage of airport design, it is difficult, or even impossible, to meet all essential \ntechnical and operational needs required by those who will be in charge of the resolution of a crisis. Compromises and \ncost-effective, short-term solutions found at a late stage of design could have expensive and tragic consequences if a \ncrisis occurs. \n \n2.3 \nA well-operated and equipped EOC is indispensable in the management of a response to a major airport \nemergency, such as unlawful seizure of an aircraft, a bomb threat against an aircraft or aviation facilities, and other acts \nof sabotage or terrorism occurring at an airport. \n \n2.4 \nProper facilities, even if they appear disproportionate, should be offered to the entities to be directly \ninvolved in the resolution of a crisis, as the magnitude of an emergency may require the deployment of a large number \nof experts and specialized equipment for a long period of time. \n \n \nSensitive Security Information \nDissemination, reproduction or onward distribution of this document is expressly prohibited without the consent of the originators. \n \nApp 17-1",

Furthermore, additional parking for support vehicles such as fire, \ncatering and off-airport mobile communication vehicles should be provided in close proximity to the facility. \n \n2.10 \nThe route to the facility, and the facility itself, should be clearly signposted as a restricted area and/or for \nauthorized personnel and vehicles only, including signs to direct personnel and vehicles, in order to facilitate expeditious \nentry and exit. \n \n2.11 \nThe command room should have a direct view of the airside of the airport, the aprons, and the isolated \naircraft parking position. If such a view is not possible, then maximum use of CCTV equipment to provide such a view \nfrom all angles is recommended. \n \n \nDesign \n \n2.12 \nThe facility should be designed in such a fashion that it accommodates all the elements that will be \nrequired for response to a crisis. It should facilitate communication but enable effective command and control of the \nresponse. The following aspects should be considered in the design of the facility: \n \na) \nentrance. This should be large enough to facilitate the simultaneous arrival of several persons at the \nfacility and equipped with an outer control point to ensure only authorized staff or visitors enter the \nbuilding;",

This is the nerve centre of the facility and should house the management and \ncommand elements, including the majority of the crisis communication equipment. A limited number of \nauthorized staff should be allowed access, and provision should be made to control access during \nboth normal hours and during a crisis. The command centre provides a focal point where the incident \ncommander can receive all necessary data to formulate plans, make decisions, and transmit \ninstructions quickly and efficiently to agencies in the field. The centre should be kept as quiet as \npossible through the use of sound-absorbing material on floors, walls and ceilings, and should have an \nindependently controlled lighting and ventilation system in order to provide a calm and controlled \nenvironment to facilitate the problem-solving and decision-making processes. The layout of the \ncommand centre should provide individual consoles or cubicles for the different agencies involved in \nthe incident. In order to maintain low noise levels, monitoring and communication equipment should be \noperated using individual headsets, with the option to use open speakers when necessary. The \nincident commander and immediate assistant(s) should be accommodated in a separate room within \nthe command centre, in order to provide the commander with space and a quiet environment in which \nto assess the situation, make telephone calls and discuss tactical options. The use of a glass partition \nwall will enable the incident commander to view activities in the command centre without being \ndistracted by noise; \n \nc) \nnegotiation team room. A separate facility immediately adjacent to the command centre with access \nbetween the two should be provided for the negotiation team and include such basic elements as \ncomfortable seating, external and internal communications equipment, video and sound recording and \nplayback equipment, and CCTV monitors. The room should be capable of being operated by a \nminimum of four persons making up the hostage negotiation team: negotiator, negotiator\u2019s \nassistant/prompter, psychiatrist and team leader; \n \nd) \nbriefing room. A separate facility is required to provide regular situation reports to newly arriving \npersonnel and logistical support services as well as specialized agencies called in to assist, such as \nEOD or armed intervention units and intelligence officers. If possible, the briefing room should be \ncapable of being subdivided into two rooms using folding screens or sliding partitions, to be able to \ncarry out two separate briefings simultaneously if necessary. The briefing of news media should be \nconducted in a location well away from the EOC; \n \ne) \ncommunications room. This room should house personnel and equipment that, although not directly \nrelated to the decision-making process as carried out in the command centre, provide supporting \nfacilities to the commanders. Noisy communication equipment such as facsimile and telex machines, \nteleprinters and the EOC telephone switchboard should be located here; and \n \nf) \nkitchen, restroom and washing facilities. A major security emergency may take several days to be \nresolved and, as such, restroom and washing facilities for all staff, male and female, should be \nprovided. A kitchen capable of producing light food and refreshments, with adequate seating \naccommodation, should also be included. \n \n2.13 \nRaised flooring should be used to the extent practicable in this facility as it provides the most flexible \nmeans of installing the various ducts and trunking for communications and computer equipment. Such flooring would \nalso facilitate adding or updating equipment as required with the minimum of disruption. Ducting through the walls of the \nfacility should also be considered to allow cables from mobile communications equipment or secondary back-up \nequipment to be connected to equipment within the facility.",

The media should be dealt \nwith fairly but firmly to ensure that they do not publish information that may prejudice action being planned or taken by \nsecurity forces. Information about the incident should be controlled at all times so that police and aircraft radio \ncommunications are not intercepted and rebroadcast as news items over public networks. Camera teams should be \nprevented from infiltrating the incident area and filming operations, as this may dangerously heighten tension among \nperpetrators, while premature disclosure of information regarding operations can frustrate tactical plans. \n \n2.25 \nA press and media room should not be located near the EOC facility. A location in the terminal building is \nmore suitable and more easily accessible. \n \n \nIsolated aircraft parking position \n \n2.26 \nIsolated aircraft parking positions should be located at the maximum distance possible from other aircraft \nparking positions, buildings or public areas and the airport fence. Isolated aircraft parking positions may also be used in \nthe event of an aircraft hijacking or bomb threat, but if taxiways or runways pass within this area, they may have to be \nclosed to normal operations when a suspect aircraft is in the area. Input on ideal locations for these positions should be \nsought from the security or law enforcement agencies that will respond to such an incident. \n \n2.27 \nAn isolated aircraft parking position may also serve as a security parking area, where an aircraft \nthreatened with unlawful interference may be parked as long as necessary or positioned for the loading or unloading of \npassengers. It may also be necessary to remove and examine cargo, mail, and stores from an aircraft during bomb \nthreat conditions. Care should be taken to ensure that the position is not located over underground utilities such as \ngasoline aviation fuel storage, water mains or electrical or communications cables. Such parking areas should ideally be \nlocated in such a position as to eliminate the possibility of unauthorized persons physically reaching or being able to \nlaunch an attack against aircraft. Consideration should also be given to the prevailing wind direction and aircraft landing \nand take-off routing at the airport, to minimize disruption to airport operations and the surrounding locality in the event of \nan aircraft fire or release of dangerous substances from the aircraft. Further, it should be possible to monitor the isolated \naircraft parking position from the airport terminal area and EOC. \n \n2.28 \nStandard 3.14.1 and Recommended Practice 3.14.2 of Volume I of Annex 14 \u2013 Aerodromes on isolated \naircraft parking positions should also be taken into consideration.",

A Class 1 system \noffers the lowest level of security and a Class 4 system the highest, as follows: \n \na) \nclass 1 \u2013 an alarm system for use in low-risk premises where potential intruders have little knowledge \nof alarm systems and a limited range of readily available tools. Such systems are unlikely to have an \nappointed response force but will rely on a public response to a local alarm or strobe lights; \n \nb) \nclass 2 \u2013 an alarm system normally used in premises where the risk of a sophisticated attack is not \nhigh. Intruders are expected to have a limited knowledge of alarm systems and have only basic tools \nand portable instruments available; \n \nc) \nclass 3 \u2013 an alarm system used in premises where high-value assets are held. Such a system will also \ninclude appropriate physical security protection. It should offer protection from intruders who are \nconversant with an intrusion detection system and have available a comprehensive range of tools and \nportable electronic equipment; and \n \nd) \nclass 4 \u2013 an alarm system intended for use in applications where security takes precedence over all \nother factors. It is intended to offer a level of protection from intruders who are expected to plan an \nintrusion in detail and have a full range of equipment capable of disabling vital system components. A \nClass 4 system will need to be supplemented with comprehensive physical security measures and \nprocedures. \n \n1.3 \nAn intrusion detection system provides continuous coverage of the protected area and, when used in \nconjunction with a CCTV system, may extend coverage into areas not normally accessible to guard patrols, such as a \nroof space or locked rooms. An intrusion detection system should be viewed as a component of the perimeter security \nsystem, rather than as a stand-alone system. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSensitive Security Information \nDissemination, reproduction or onward distribution of this document is expressly prohibited without the consent of the originators. \n \nApp 18-1",

In preparing a \nrequest for a proposal, the end-user requirements for an intrusion detection system installation should specify: \n \na) \nthe area and/or equipment to be protected; \n \nb) \nthe level or degree of threat; \n \nc) \nwhether linkage to other electronic systems is required, such as CCTV or automated access control; \n \nd) \nwhether the protected area will have an on-site guard force or a signal to a response force; and \n \ne) \nthe type of reaction force or monitoring arrangements required. \n \n \nSystem components \n \n1.5 \nAn intrusion detection system installation will normally include some or all of the following system \ncomponents: \n \na) \ndetection sensors; \n \nb) \ncontrol panel with optional event recorder and printer; \n \nc) \nalarm display; \n \nd) \nalarm signalling link between control panel and alarm display; \n \ne) \ninstallation wiring; \n \nf) \nreaction force; and \n \ng) \nindependent or back-up power supply, as appropriate. \n \n \nDetection sensors \n \n1.6 \nDetection sensors are designed to detect an intrusion within the area they cover and to provide an \nindication to the control panel of the alarm condition. Different types of sensors are available, the choice of which will \ndepend on the nature of the location to be protected, and different types may be used in combination to cover technical \nvulnerabilities, reduce the incidence of false alarms, and provide against failure.

Switches can be used in either make or \nbreak mode, that is, open or closed circuit, but care should be taken to ensure that an accidental or \ndeliberate loss of power will cause the system to fail safe and raise an alarm. In high-security \ninstallations, magnetic reed switches should be of the double-reed type, which incorporate a tamper- \nprotection switch; \n \nb) \nspatial or volumetric sensors, which are designed to detect movement within their field of view and are \nused to cover rooms, corridors, roof spaces and other open areas or entry routes. Ultrasonic sensors \nuse high-frequency sound waves and the Doppler effect of radiated and reflected transmissions. They \nare reliable and difficult to defeat but can generate false alarms from air turbulence or extraneous \nsounds such as telephone bells. Passive infrared sensors monitor the infrared heat profile of an area \nand detect changes caused by human intrusion. Microwave sensors use high-frequency radio \ntransmissions and reflection to detect movement. Because of the penetrating properties of \nmicrowaves, careful installation is necessary to avoid false alarms caused by movement outside the \nprotected area; \n \nc) \nbeam interruption devices, which are usually of the active infrared type, and use a transmitter and \nreceiver and sometimes reflecting devices to project a beam across an opening such as a door or \nwindow. When the beam is broken, either by the opening of the door or window or by a person \npassing through it, an alarm is raised. \n \nd) \nvibration detection devices, which detect vibrations by various devices or technologies, such as: an \ninertia switch that reacts to vibration or impact with a contact ball that bounces or lifts off its contacts \nand produces an alarm condition; a geophone that detects movement with a suspended magnet \nmoving inside a detector coil; or piezoelectric crystals that produce an electric current from structural \npressures. Once vibrations are detected, an alarm is raised; and \n \ne) \ndual technology sensors, which are devices that combine two sensor technologies such as passive \ninfrared and microwave in one housing, where they work together before signalling an alarm. In this \nway, the likelihood of false alarms is greatly reduced. Dual technology sensors should be used with \ncare and only where the local conditions allow no alternative, since the danger exists that the overall \nsensitivity of the system may be reduced if there is a requirement for two devices to be activated \ntogether before an alarm is sent. \n \nControl panel \n \n1.8 \nThe main functions of a control panel are to: \n \na) \nmonitor the state of detection sensors; \n \nb) \ndetect tampering; \n \nc) \nallow the system to be turned on and off; and \n \nd) \nsignal an alarm state.",

The recorder provides a log of all alarms and operational \ninstructions, such as the setting and unsetting of the system. Such a recorder should provide a useful aid for monitoring \nthe security of the system, as well as an audit trail. Unless the control panel is situated at a permanently staffed guard \npoint, it should be located at the heart of an intrusion detection system installation, where it is given maximum protection \nboth by the system itself and by other physical security measures. \nAlarm display \n \n1.10 \nAn alarm should be signalled to a permanently staffed control position from where the appropriate \nresponse can be made. Alarms should normally be given by both audible and visible means and should identify the \nlocation and type of alarm. In sophisticated systems, computer graphics and visual display units may be used to indicate \nthe particular zone or areas in which the alarm has occurred and the actions to be taken by the guard. \n \n1.11 \nIn low-risk sites covered by commercial and/or domestic burglar alarm equipment, the alarm signalling may \nbe provided by an external alarm bell and strobe light. Such systems usually rely on a public response to the alarm as \nthere is not normally a designated response force. The use of publicly audible and/or visible alarm signals in high- \nsecurity installations is not generally recommended, as such alarms indicate to an attacker where alarm sensors are \ninstalled and what reaction an alarm will cause, and the vulnerabilities of the system can then be identified and exploited. \n \n \nAlarm signalling \n \n1.12 \nSome form of remote alarm signalling to an alarm monitoring station will be necessary if the protected site \nis remote or not permanently staffed. Alarm signals may be communicated via different means. The most common are \ndescribed below: \n \na) \nprivate wires \u2013 direct telephone lines used exclusively for alarm signalling and monitoring. This system \nprovides protection against shorting out or cutting the lines, which will cause an immediate alarm. \nPrivate wires can be expensive; \n \nb) \nauto-dialling \u2013 a standard exchange telephone line and equipment that, when an alarm is raised, \nautomatically dials an emergency call number and relays a pre-recorded message. For this system the \nline should be ex-directory or selected as an outgoing calls only system. This will guard against the \nline being blocked by incoming calls, which would prevent the transmission of an alarm. These \nsystems do not allow for permanent line monitoring and cannot immediately identify line faults or cut \nlines. They are therefore not recommended for high-security installations; and \n \nc) \nradio-links \u2013 provide a multipath communications system which can incorporate a number of features \nsuch as automatic paging, data encryption and two-way interrogation and response protocol. The \nselected system and the facilities offered will need to be carefully considered to ensure the appropriate \nlevel of security is achieved.",

In other \nwords, there should be continuous electronic examination of the circuit connections to ensure that they are in working \norder and are not being tampered with. There should be an immediate alarm if a fault occurs or line tampering is \ndetected. The level of line monitoring in installations of a lower security standard is normally only suitable for use within \nthe protected area. Installation wiring that lies outside the protected area cannot be considered secure unless additional \nphysical protection is provided, such as the use of protected ducts or armoured cables. \n \n \nReaction force \n \n1.14 \nThe intrusion alarms should be expeditiously responded to and validated. The response time should be as \nshort as practicable and in any event should aim to identify, locate and intercept an intruder before he or she can reach \nhis or her intended target, such as the passenger apron, or carry out an attack. \n \n \nSetting and unsetting \n \n1.15 \nFor unstaffed sites it is necessary to have a setting up procedure to allow the intrusion detection system to \nbe switched on and off by authorized personnel without causing an alarm. Types of setting up procedures include the \nfollowing: \n \na) \nautomatic time setting, which allows the system to set and unset at a pre-set time; \n \nb) \na time delay, where the system allows a pre-set time elapse to permit the user to leave or enter the \nprotected site after the set or before the unset procedure has been completed without raising the \nalarm. Time delay may not be appropriate in areas close to vulnerable points where a very quick \nintervention is required; \n \nc) \nlast exit system, in which the closure of the last exit door from a building or site activates the intrusion \ndetection system through a switch mounted in the door frame or in the lock; and \n \nd) \na personal identification number key pad, which is placed outside the protected area and requires the \nentry of a code to set the system or to start the timed entry counter. \n \n \nSystem management \n \n \nInstallation and maintenance \n \n1.16 \nThe integrity of an intrusion detection system depends on proper installation and maintenance. Circuit \ndiagrams, manuals and spare components for intrusion detection system installations should always be kept under \nsecure conditions. Likewise, all installation and maintenance work should be carried out by authorized personnel and \nsupervised by security staff. Any modifications to the system should be recorded, and this record should be held with the \noriginal specification or diagrams.",

Float charge batteries are normally used for \nthis purpose, and should have a sufficient capacity to cope with foreseeable contingencies. The condition of the batteries \nshould be regularly checked by authorized personnel. \n \n \nAccess control panel \n \n1.18 \nAn intrusion detection system should only be set or unset by authorized personnel. The control panel \nshould therefore be positioned and protected so as to deny access to all but nominated staff. If a control panel is key \noperated, the key should never be left in the panel and should be treated as a security key. Operating codes should be \nprotected in the same way as combination lock settings or system passwords. If the control panel is sited within an area \nthat is not permanently supervised, it may be necessary to prevent unauthorized access by securing it in an approved \nsecurity cabinet or container. The container should be kept locked and protected by the intrusion detection system. \n \n \nAccess to sensors \n \n1.19 \nEvery effort should be made to ensure that unauthorized personnel do not have access to installed \nintrusion detection system sensors. The tamper alarms should be monitored continuously, and the correct operation of \nall sensors should be checked at regular intervals. \n \n \nWalk-test lights \n \n1.20 \nWalk-test lights, usually a red light emitting diode mounted on the front face of a sensor, indicate that the \ndevice is operating. However, this indication can be deceptive and should not be taken as a test of the system. The only \neffective way of testing an intrusion detection system installation is to activate a sensor and check that an alarm has \nbeen raised. Walk-test lights can also be an aid to an attacker by indicating the coverage or range of a sensor. It is \ntherefore strongly advised that walk-test lights be masked or disconnected in all high-security installations. \n \n \nTesting \n \n1.21 \nAn intrusion detection system installed in a high-security site should be tested at least once per day. If this \nis not possible, the system should be tested regularly at intervals to be prescribed in local security regulations. Such \ntesting should include a check on the functioning and sensitivity of each individual sensor and on the correct receipt of \nthe alarm signal at the control panel. Any malfunctions should be reported immediately for rectification by relevant \nsecurity management. \n \n \nEvent logs \n \n1.22 \nIf event recorders are fitted, they should be examined regularly by security management staff and \ncompared, where appropriate, to reports submitted by the guard force. Staff should be trained to recognize the \ndevelopment of a suspicious sequence of events and have the authority to investigate incidents. If a hard-copy printout \nof events is obtained, it should be stored for a period of not less than three years to allow for retrospective analysis and \ninvestigation.",

In the event \nof an attack being mounted on an intrusion detection system, a sensor may give only one warning before it is \ncircumvented. Therefore, each alarm should be thoroughly investigated by security staff, if necessary in conjunction with \nan intrusion detection system engineer, and every attempt made to establish the cause. The possibility should also be \nconsidered that a sequence of unexplained alarms occurring over a prolonged period of time may indicate that probing \nattacks are being carried out or that an attacker is attempting to undermine confidence in the system. \n \n \nRefurbishment of buildings \n \n1.24 \nIf buildings or individual suites of offices are refurbished after an intrusion detection system has been \ninstalled, the rearrangement of partition walls and repositioning of protected equipment may reduce the level of \nprotection originally provided by the system. A new survey should therefore be carried out and the system installation \nadapted to the new accommodation arrangements. While building renovations are in progress, care should be taken to \nprevent building workers from having unsupervised access to components of the system, and a thorough check of the \nsystem should be carried out once the work is completed.

In the simplest system, a camera is linked by a cable to its own monitor, which is normally located in a staffed \ncontrol centre. More complex systems include cameras fitted with zoom lenses and pan and tilt facilities, referred to as \nmobile cameras, and the use of artificial lighting, either visible or infrared, to provide 24-hour surveillance. The possible \napplications include supplementing intrusion detection systems such as the verification and checking of alarms, and \nmonitoring of: \n \na) \nspecific areas, such as parking; \n \nb) \npin-pointed areas, such as surveillance of equipment or entry points which could not otherwise be \ncovered; \n \nc) \nremote ATS sites or premises; \n \nd) \nperimeter alarms; and \n \ne) \nequipment. \n \n \nSpecifying operational requirements \n \n2.3 \nIt is important to clearly define the performance requirements of a CCTV system, which should cover: \n \na) \nthe areas to be monitored and the purpose for which monitoring of each area is required, such as for \naccess control or alarm assessment; \n \nb) \nthe picture quality required in each area monitored.

The key factors to consider in the development of a hold \nbaggage screening system are summarized in Table A19-1. \n \n1.3 \nThe security equipment with the best performance in terms of the detection of explosives or explosive \ndevices should be selected.

Unless such facilities are designed to be compatible with future traffic demand, the \nmodification or expansion of a system may involve significant cost and disruption to operations. For these reasons, \nrobust forecasts of future traffic patterns and plans for the expansion of an airport or terminal should be developed. As \nwell as the most likely forecast scenario, planners should take into account the consequences of other scenarios \ninvolving greater and lesser growth rates, to ensure that the proposed solution is sufficiently flexible to deal with \nreasonable, unplanned changes without major modifications. \n \n \nPassenger traffic flows \n \n2.2 \nData and forecasts of passenger flows are the first and fundamental element to establish in the planning \nprocess for a hold baggage screening facility. Such data should include: \n \na) \nannual traffic levels, including departure and transfer traffic; \n \nb) \ntraffic patterns and variations within one year, including seasonal changes; \n \nc) \ntraffic patterns and variations within one day, including patterns of check-in operations, counter and/or \nbelt allocations, check-in opening and closure times for flight schedules, etc.; \n \nd) \ntraffic types such as domestic and international flights, scheduled and charter operations, etc.; and",

The peak demand is a critical parameter in the planning of capacity. A peak demand \nfor 15 minutes can generate significant problems if there is insufficient capacity to deal with the throughput, and the \neffects can continue for some time after the demand has lessened. Therefore, the importance of peak demand should \nnot be underestimated. \n \nBaggage types \n \n2.4 \nThe number of items of hold baggage to be processed is another critical parameter in the planning and \ndevelopment of a hold baggage screening facility. The number of items of baggage per passenger should be considered, \nand will vary between the different types of passengers (including the proportion of business passengers) and flights, \nincluding charter flights short-haul and/or long-haul flights and scheduled flights, as well as the amount (throughput) of \nout-of-gauge and transfer baggage. Out-of-gauge baggage is commonly defined by IATA standards as baggage whose \ndimensions exceed: \n \na) \nmaximum size: length 0.90 m, width 0.70 m, height 0.50 m; and \n \nb) \nminimum size: length 0.30 m, width 0.20 m, height 0.10 m. \n \n2.5 \nSome machines used for hold baggage screening, explosives detection systems (EDS) in particular, have \nlimited inspection tunnel sizes which can impose operating problems for some handling systems. As a consequence, \nspecific equipment and procedures may be required for out-of-gauge baggage. \n \nForecasting of demand \n \n2.6 \nThe throughput requirements for a hold baggage screening system may be determined by combining the \ninformation on passenger flows with the baggage parameters, in particular the peak demand, which is critical to the \ndetermination of the design capacity of the total system. The volume of demand should be considered not only at the \nfirst stage in the screening process, but also at each subsequent level. A capacity shortfall at any level may have a \nserious effect on the operation of preceding stages in the process. In extreme cases, this may lead to a slowdown in the \nsystem which may bring the queue and the processes at check-in counters associated with that queue to a standstill. \n \n2.7 \nIn addition to the quantitative parameters above, it is necessary to consider a number of more qualitative \nissues which may affect capacity assessments. Particular consideration should be given to the proportion of baggage \nthat is rejected at each level and the time that an operator will need to effectively assess the image of a baggage, which \nwill be strongly influenced by the size, nature and density of the contents of the baggage. For example, densely packed \nbaggage containing many electrical items and articles which are difficult to assess will, inevitably, take longer to examine \nand resolve. The incidence and pattern of such baggage should be included in the consideration of capacity \nrequirements for the hold baggage screening process. The time needed by an operator may, in turn, affect the \nthroughput of baggage and/or the reject rate, defined as the proportion of baggage passing through a level or stage in \nthe process that needs to be examined at the next level in the process. In terms of rejection rates, two types of alarms \nare possible: \n \na) \nthreat alarms, which occur when the system believes it has detected potential explosive material. \nHowever, some innocent items, such as food, plastic materials and electronic components, can \ngenerate an alarm in EDS or other X-ray-based detection systems; and",

At this stage, a range of options at the different levels in the process should be \nconsidered, including consideration of the performance of various types of screening equipment, reject rates of the \nscreening options, space and resource requirements, facilitation and service issues, etc. \n \n2.9 \nThe proportion of baggage that is referred for manual search and baggage reconciliation can have \nsignificant operational facilitation and service implications. This proportion is largely determined by the reject rates at the \npreceding stages and the effectiveness of the baggage analysis and assessment capabilities of the preceding stages. \n \n \nGeneral airport constraints \n \n2.10 \nOnce traffic and baggage flows have been analysed, designers should consider the baggage facilities and \nhold baggage screening systems within the context of the overall airport and terminal concept. Baggage facilities and \nscreening systems require considerable space. Keeping these systems as simple as possible minimizes cost and \noperational and maintenance difficulties. Compatibility with key structural elements, architectural concepts and \nfacilitation issues should be ensured. \n \n \nSpace requirements and location issues \n \n2.11 \nHold baggage screening facilities often require considerable space for related equipment, as well as for \nscreening operator facilities, manual search facilities, sterile areas, where appropriate, and operational and maintenance \naccess. The location of the space required will depend, in part, on where the screening equipment is located. If \nscreening facilities are located at, or before, check-in, the space required includes areas where passengers may need to \nqueue before the screening checkpoint(s). Spaces to be set aside for the screening process will be located primarily in \nareas normally occupied by public and commercial functions. If screening facilities are located beyond check-in, the \nspace required for hold baggage screening operations will be located primarily in areas normally allocated for baggage \nprocessing and loading. \n \n2.12 \nThe allocation of space is relatively straightforward when a new terminal or extension is being planned. \nHowever, if hold baggage screening is to be introduced into an existing terminal operation, the impact on existing space, \noperations, architecture and structures should be carefully considered to achieve an effective, coordinated solution. \n \n \nAirport structures \n \n2.13 \nIf hold baggage screening is to be introduced into an existing terminal operation, all existing structural \nelements should be taken into account in the planning phase to ensure that the baggage conveyors and screening \nsystems can be developed without unnecessary conflicts or constraints which may adversely affect the performance of \nthese critical systems. If there are structural elements that are very difficult and/or expensive to move or replace, such as \nlift and service cores, baggage systems should be designed in such a way that these structural elements do not inhibit \noperational, maintenance or security performance.",

Depending on the baggage flows to be \nscreened, a number of different solutions are possible, for example: \n \na) \na single hold baggage screening facility can be installed, serving all check-in counters; \n \nb) \neach check-in counter can have its own hold baggage screening facility; and \n \nc) \nmore than one hold baggage screening facility can be installed, each serving different check-in zones, \nbut linked to provide support for each other in the event of an overload or breakdown in one of the \nsystems. \n \n2.16 \nSome hold baggage screening systems can require modifications to the check-in counters or the zone \naround the check-in facilities. It is important to carefully consider the impact of such changes on check-in and other \noperational activities. This may require, for example, the provision of more space for check-in counters, either to \naccommodate the integration of X-ray equipment into the check-in counters and/or to provide additional counters \nbecause of increased processing times at check-in, or the provision of more space for equipment and passenger \nqueuing and/or processing areas. \n \n \nExisting handling facilities and operation modes \n \n2.17 \nIf hold baggage screening is introduced into an existing terminal, the location of the hold baggage \nscreening system at or before check-in or as freestanding equipment in the baggage hall is unlikely to affect baggage \nhandling systems already in place. However, if hold baggage screening is to be integrated into existing mechanized \nbaggage systems, significant modification, or even replacement, of the baggage system may be required. \n \n2.18 \nIf existing baggage handling facilities are adequate for a sorting operation and hold baggage screening \nfacility installation, it may be possible to reuse such facilities, including conveyor belts, check-in counters, etc., in order to \nlimit investment costs and inconvenience to operations. \n \n2.19 \nTo minimize potential disruption and additional costs, the design of a hold baggage screening system \nshould take account of future development of the airport or terminal. As far as possible, a hold baggage screening \nsystem should be compatible with future development plans and extended, where necessary, with the minimum of \ndisruption and modification to existing systems. \n \n \nOperational issues \n \n2.20 \nThe planning process for the selection and development of appropriate hold baggage screening facilities \nshould include a full consideration of the effect on other airport operations.

Likely reject rates from the first, and subsequent, levels should also \nbe considered, as well as the consequences in terms of equipment and resources that would be needed to examine \nbaggage that is not cleared. In some cases, equipment that has a high throughput rate but generates a high rate of \nrejected baggage may not be cost effective, and machines with a lower throughput but a high detection and low false \nalarm rate may be the preferred alternative. It is recommended that a number of options be examined and verified for \nthe overall system. \n \n2.23 \nIf check-in facilities are dispersed, operators may conclude that the optimum solution is to use several \nmachines with relatively low throughput capability, located near the different check-in and sorting systems.

Detector effectiveness is very sensitive to the distance between the detector and a threat object, whereby if \nthe detector is not close enough, the threat will be missed. \n \n2.4 \nDetection problems may be encountered if a screener uses an HHMD on an area of interest or if the \ndetector is held too far from the threat. This is particularly a problem in sensitive areas on the person, where the drape of \nclothing may preclude effective screening. HHMDs are often used in conjunction with manual searches. \n \n \nWTMD \n \n2.4 \nCurrent walk-through metal detectors employ a pulsed magnetic field, which induces eddy currents in any \nmetallic conductor. When the field is shut off, the eddy current collapses, resulting in a weak signature that is related to \nthe type, size, orientation and position of any metallic object in the archway. The weak signature is captured, digitized \nand analysed by software set at a level appropriate to the threat. For example, different software may detect precious \nmetals, improvised small weapons, larger weapons or innocent metallic objects. \n \n2.5 \nWTMDs are widely used in aviation and other security venues. Detection problems can be encountered, \nparticularly at the floor level, where reinforcing iron may perturb the magnetic field, causing reduced detection sensitivity. \nDetection is further complicated by the steel shanks in many shoes, which can cause false alarms, as can floor \nvibrations or stray magnetic fields caused by nearby power lines, elevators or moving equipment. Current airport metal \ndetectors operate at a low enough magnetic field strength so as to not interfere with implanted medical devices. \nHowever, individuals with such devices will usually cause an alarm that will require resolution. \n \n2.6 \nAlthough the electromagnetic emissions from both types of detectors should be too weak to cause any \nharm to the body, medical implants such as heart pacemakers could potentially be affected. It is necessary, therefore, to \nensure that manufacturers have a certification from a competent authority that states the equipment can be used to \nscreen persons with such implants. \n \n2.7 \nThe location of WTMDs affects their performance, and they should be located away from large moving \nmetal objects, such as doors. In addition, if a WTMD is used adjacent to another, it should be ensured that they do not \ninterfere electrically with each other.",

The development of alternative, or supplemental, solutions that can \nenhance security effectiveness is ongoing. \n \n \nHHMDs versus WTMDs \n \n2.10 \nHand-held detectors have advantages over the walk-through or archway, with respect to: \n \na) \naccuracy, by being able to pinpoint the exact location on the body of a potential threat item; \n \nb) \nportability; and \n \nc) \nunit cost. \n \n2.11 \nThe disadvantages of HHMDs in comparison with WTMDs are: \n \na) \nclose proximity of the screener to the person being screened; \n \nb) \nreliance on the screener\u2019s accuracy and performance; and \n \nc) \ntime required to complete the search. \n \n2.12 \nThe advantages of WTMDs are: \n \na) \nspeed of processing; \n \nb) \nassurance of uniformity and consistency of screening, not dependent on screener performance; and \n \nc) \nless intrusive nature. \n \n2.13 \nThe key disadvantage of WTMDs is that they must be in a fixed location. \n \n2.14 \nOther technologies may be used in conjunction with or in replacement of metal detection equipment.

Areas of low atomic number (called Z) such as \nflesh and explosives, reflect low energy X-rays and show up on the image as bright. High Z objects like metal and \nceramics show up as dark on the image. \n \n \nOperational utilization \n \n3.9 \nThe high resolution, which actually causes privacy issues, and low radiation insult, makes X-ray \nbackscatter an attractive first- or second-level process for screening passengers for both metallic and non-metallic \nthreats carried under their clothing. Systems being operationally deployed have privacy filters which blur parts of the \nimage. In addition operational procedures are used to visually separate the image viewing screener from the passenger \nand to preclude capturing or retaining an image of the passenger. The systems produce an image of all objects carried \nby the passenger and do not currently differentiate a wallet from a threat. The operator\u2019s challenge is to recognize the \nthreat in part by shape.",

There are three different approaches \nto the detection of explosive traces: \n \na) \nexplosive particulate; \n \nb) \nexplosive vapour; and \n \nc) \ncanine olfaction. \n \n \nTechnology \n \n4.2 \nMost trace detectors today use ion mobility spectrometry to detect explosives. Mass spectrometry has the \npotential for greater sensitivity and specificity than other techniques. Trace detectors use a multi-step process whereby \nthe screener samples an area likely to be contaminated, then transfers the sampling media to the detector, where the \nresidue is analysed. The challenge in trace detection is to sample the area likely to contain contamination and to sample \nthoroughly enough to dislodge the explosive particulates from where they cling to surfaces. \n \n \nOperational utilization \n \n4.3 \nExplosives trace detectors detect a range of commercial, military and homemade explosives with \noperational false alarms below one per cent. Problems in loss of sensitivity are encountered with prolonged use without \nclean-up, but this issue is generally properly addressed. \n \n \n \n5. \nCONVENTIONAL X-RAYS \n \n5.1 \nExplosives and weapons can be detected in cabin baggage through the recognition of their image by a \nscreener on a transmission X-ray system. Today\u2019s systems provide multiple transmission views and material \ncomposition information beyond density, to allow for easier threat recognition. \n \n \nTechnology \n \n5.2 \nA majority of the systems currently deployed use a 160 kV X-ray fan beam to produce a high-resolution \nimage that provides operators with information on density and material. Multiple beam systems that provide operators \nwith additional information are becoming more common. Also, additional image manipulation tools are available to \noperators, including zoom, dynamic range manipulation and edge enhancement. \n \n5.3 \nSingle-view conventional X-ray systems provide only one X-ray image of a piece of baggage to the \noperator (the screener), who views objects from one fixed position. The use of single-view X-ray systems in the \ndetection of prohibited items is therefore limited due to the unique angle at which the X-ray beam hits the baggage. As a \nresult, the screener may need to run a piece of baggage through several times, positioning it differently each time on the",

Such a \nprocess is meant to ensure that objects in the baggage are not masked by other, more dense objects. \n \n5.4 \nOn the other hand, dual/multi-view systems provide more than one X-ray image of the same baggage or \nitem and hence provide the security screener with multiple perspectives or angles of that baggage or item. These \nsystems lead to a higher detection performance of prohibited items by security screeners especially in difficult conditions \n(e.g. items placed in close packed bags or superimposed by other objects). \n \n5.5 \nCertain multi-view X-ray systems may provide automated detection of prohibited items based on the use of \nspecific algorithms, leading to a substantial improvement of security. \n \n \nOperational utilization \n \n5.6 \nConventional X-ray systems are employed worldwide for the screening of cabin baggage and depend \nalmost exclusively on operator interpretation of the image and recognition of the threat. The complexity of images \ncontaining electronics makes it difficult for screeners to isolate threat images. That\u2019s why in some States it is mandatory \nto take large electronic items out of cabin baggage before they are screened using X-ray machines. \n \n5.7 \nWhen conventional X-ray systems are used for the screening of hold baggage, it should be recognized that \nhold bags are usually larger than cabin bags and may also be more complex. This makes interpretation of the images \nand the detection of improvised explosive devices by operators harder, and the technology should therefore be \nsupplemented by other means like explosives trace detection, manual search, etc. \n \n5.8 \nIn the case of cargo, the nature of the consignment has a very big influence on whether conventional X-ray \nis an effective means of screening. If the cargo is particularly dense, the X-ray beams may be unable to penetrate the \nconsignment and therefore make it impossible for an operator to find improvised explosive devices. In such cases other \nmeans of screening should be employed. \n \n5.9 \nWhen using conventional X-ray systems, the following items can be detected through image interpretation \nby a trained operator only: \n \na) \nguns and devices that discharge projectiles; \n \nb) \nknives and sharp objects (metallic and non-metallic); \n \nc) \nexplosives; \n \nd) \nIED components; \n \ne) \nstunning devices; \n \nf) \nblunt instruments; \n \ng) \nincendiaries; and \n \nh) \nincapacitant sprays.",

Explosives \nhave unique X-ray interaction characteristics compared to everyday materials, and the measurement of these \ncharacteristics can be used to identify material that has a high probability of being explosive.

CT images are acquired by one or more linear arrays of X-ray detectors on a rotating gantry illuminated by one \nX-ray source (typically about 160 kV) that is also on the gantry that rotates around the baggage to be screened. The \nimages generated by the detectors are collected and compiled, and from the reconstructed section of the baggage, the \nshape and density of each object in the beam may be estimated. The computer algorithm determines whether there are \nobjects in the baggage of sufficient size and appropriate density to be a threat. Some CT systems are designed to \nprovide single sections, whose position is determined by a prescreen of the baggage. Other CT systems continuously \nacquire multiple sections as the gantry rotates and the baggage moves continuously through the gantry. \n \n7.4 \nA limited number of CT systems currently employ dual energy to allow an estimation of the Z (atomic \nnumber) of each object in the beam, in addition to the density.

Such events \nhave forced State authorities to take additional security measures to protect civil aviation from potential terrorist attacks, \nincluding by deploying advanced technologies aimed at detecting threats of varying complexity. Notwithstanding \nadvancements in security technologies, a minimum standard is required to ensure that the best-suited equipment is \nprocured and that its deployment is adapted to emerging threats. While most States determine the deployment of such \nequipment within their territories, a consistent and standardized international approach to the establishment of minimum \nspecifications for security equipment is key to assisting States in their development and implementation of new \ntechnology and security equipment. \n \n1.2 \nA standardized approach to the setting of standards and the establishment of baseline processes for \naviation security equipment may help ensure the consistent screening of threat items in an increasing number of States. \nThis approach may also serve as a deterrent to terrorists attempting to find gaps in the global aviation security screening \nsystems and regimes, as they will be confronted with consistency in both the equipment being used and the associated \nprocesses. \n \n1.3 \nThe framework proposed in this appendix is designed to be applied to any type of technology. \n \n \n2. \nFRAMEWORK \n \nThe setting of minimal specifications for security equipment requires a structured approach with integrated elements, in \norder to achieve a specific security objective or outcome. The key elements for consideration are: \n \na) \nthreat identification; \n \nb) \ndetection capability and technology; \n \nc) \noperational requirements and considerations; and \n \nd) \nconcept of operations and standard operating procedures. \n \n \n3. \nTHREAT IDENTIFICATION \n \n3.1 \nState appropriate authorities and intelligence agencies should collate information on global terrorist \norganizations and threat items that have been used in past incidents, in order to determine current and emerging threats. \nCollecting data from a variety of sources, both nationally and internationally, should help identify items that may be used \nto carry out an act of unlawful interference.",

While those identified items and articles may be \nmultiple, States should not attempt to apply the same level of detection to each of them and rather prioritize the items \nposing the biggest threat. \n \n3.3 \nIn addition to identifying the threat, a thorough assessment should be carried out to determine the sizes \nand types of items that may be used to cause major disruptions to civil aviation, such as through the destruction of \naircraft or the use of aircraft as a weapon. States should take advantage of existing research, studies, analysis and \nreports that provide measurable characteristics of such items. Those items should include, but are not limited to: \n \na) \nfirearms and devices that discharge projectiles; \n \nb) \nknives and other sharp objects (metallic and non-metallic); \n \nc) \nexplosives; \n \nd) \nimprovised explosive device components; \n \ne) \nstunning devices; \n \nf) \nblunt instruments; \n \ng) \nincendiaries; and \n \nh) \nincapacitating sprays. \n \n3.4 \nStates should continuously review their assessment of the threats to civil aviation in order to validate \nand/or modify the security measures and requirements in place, including the minimal detection requirements, and \naddress new and evolving threats. \n \n \n \n4. \nDETECTION CAPABILITY AND TECHNOLOGY \n \n \n4.1 \nMinimum Detection Requirement \n \n4.1.1 \nOnce threat items have been identified, scientific analysis of the characteristics and properties of the threat \nshould be carried out. This analysis should advise State authorities on selecting the appropriate technology to efficiently \ndetect the threat items identified, and establishing minimum detection requirements. In this respect, States should foster \ninternational collaboration as a means to assist in the establishment of such minimum detection requirements. Those \nrequirements should also account for technology detection capabilities and limitations, and be periodically reviewed for \npotential improvements. \n \n4.1.2 \nOnce minimum detection requirements have been established, States should carry out an assessment of \nthe existing technology detection capabilities. The assessment consists of selecting key performance parameters and \nconducting an evaluation of associated detection capabilities thereafter.

This type of \nfalse alarm has an impact on security; and \n \n2) \nfalse positive: occurs when a device generates an alarm even though no threat item is present. \nThis type of false alarm has a mostly operational impact; \n \nc) \nthroughput: a system\u2019s throughput rate is expressed in units such as persons per minute, bags per \nhour, etc. The ability to screen people or items quickly is very important; and \n \nd) \nother key parameters, such as automated detection, multi-view, and image quality. \n \n4.1.3 \nIdeally, the Pd is 100 per cent and the FAR 0 per cent. In practice, this is never the case. If the Pd is higher, \nthe FAR tends to rise as well. A trade-off should be made based on the minimum Pd required and maximum \noperationally feasible FAR. In some States this trade-off is called \u201csensitivity\u201d and in others D-prime. It should be noted \nthat not all parameters may be applicable for a particular technology. \n \n4.1.4 \nWhen using an automated detection system, the performance of the system is dependent on the \nproportion of successful automated detections. To ensure system credibility, false alarm rates should therefore be the \nlowest possible. A high number of false alarms lowers operators\u2019 confidence in the technology. In such cases, operators \nmay abandon, ignore or circumvent the system altogether, thereby leading to higher levels of errors. The D-prime \ncorresponds to this measure where D equals to automated hits minus false alarms.

Fault or corrective maintenance is conducted if \nequipment has malfunctioned and is brought off line for repair and to determine the cause of the fault. \n \n4. \nComprehensive equipment maintenance schedules at airports require accurate recordkeeping and \ndocument maintenance and should include the following: \n \na) \nlists of all the items of equipment installed at an airport and their locations; \n \nb) \ntechnical records for each type of equipment, detailing in particular the equipment\u2019s technical \ncharacteristics, including natures, types, serial numbers and manufacturers; and \n \nc) \ninformation related to installation of the equipment, including the date and the names of the installer, \nperson responsible for installation, and site acceptance test conducted prior to initial operation. \n \n5. \nSuch schedules should also include: \n \na) \nidentification of a technical team leader for each item of equipment and response procedures, \nincluding the scheduled dates for periodic preventive inspections and the actual dates of any \ncorrective maintenance that has been carried out; \n \nb) \nperiodic inspection programme records, including dates of performance, measurement reports, nature \nof actions taken and to be taken, component and parts replacement schedules, dates of actions and \nnames of the technicians who performed them; and \n \nc) \ncorrective maintenance records, including the date, nature and description of corrective actions and \nthe identification of defective, repaired or replaced components.",

It is intended as reference \nmaterial for security management and training departments. \n \n \n \nDESCRIPTION OF TIP \n \n2. \nTIP is a software programme that projects fictional images of threat articles such as guns, knives and IEDs \nwithin the X-ray image of baggage under examination, and which can be installed on X-ray machines. The projected \nthreat image appears as a real threat within baggage, with no cues available to operators to indicate that it is fictional, \neither before it is presented or while it is being presented. The presentation of these images is frequent but \nunpredictable. \n \n3. \nAn operator\u2019s task, as with real threats, is to detect these threat images whenever they occur. The \nappropriate button is pressed on the control panel, and the system provides immediate feedback on the accuracy of the \nresponse. A record is kept of all responses made by an operator, thus allowing a picture of individual performance to be \nbuilt up over time. \n \n \n \nBENEFITS OF TIP \n \n4. \nWhen used appropriately, TIP can be a valuable tool for training and monitoring detection performance. \nBenefits include the regular exposure of X-ray machine operators to images of threat objects, thereby increasing their \nfamiliarity with X-ray images of such objects, which may improve their recognition ability for actual threat articles when \nthey do occur. This is especially useful for threat types that occur only rarely, such as IEDs. \n \n5. \nResearch has shown that X-ray operators enjoy using TIP systems, with many suggesting it maintains their \nmotivation and interest in the screening task. Operators have also indicated that they are more attentive when they know \nTIP images may appear during their duty period and, because they know their performance is being monitored, are more \nmotivated to do well. \n \n6. \nThe data stored by a TIP system may be useful for training purposes, and include information on the \nnumber and type of TIP images that an individual has detected or missed. Analysis of these data can help identify where \nindividual strengths and weaknesses lie, thus indicating where additional training might prove most beneficial, i.e. TIP \nsystems can help to tailor training. TIP systems can also be used to monitor the competency levels of operators.",
  "724": "App 20-30 \nAviation Security Manual \nSensitive Security Information \nDissemination, reproduction or onward distribution of this document is expressly prohibited without the consent of the originators. \n \n \n \n \nSELECTING A TIP SYSTEM \n \n7. \nCurrently, TIP software is equipment-specific, i.e. X-ray manufacturers produce TIP systems that operate \nonly on their own models of X-ray equipment. The choice of TIP systems available is therefore limited to the types of \nX-ray machines in use. Many modern X-ray machines are delivered in TIP-capable mode and the process of activating \nTIP software is straightforward, while the installation of TIP software on older machines may be more complex and/or \nnot possible. \n \n8. \nTIP systems have been tested under operational conditions and should function without any disruption to \nthe screening task. However, when TIP software is first switched on, a nominated individual should monitor the system \nfor a number of weeks to ensure that it is functioning properly, including through close examination of the accuracy of \nthe data. Such a trial period also permits screeners to become accustomed to the system before the data are formally \ncollected and used, for example, for performance monitoring purposes. \n \n \n \nPREPARING FOR TIP USE \n \n \nTIP library \n \n9. \nA fundamental component of any TIP system is the image library, consisting of a collection of threat \nimages, typically guns, knives and IEDs. The system selects threat images from this library for presentation within the \nimage of passenger baggage. Images in this library should be representative and realistic, and should also be varied \nand numerous, since this will reduce the rate at which screeners begin to recognize individual images. \n \n10. \nWhile some TIP systems are delivered with an image library installed, it is possible that some of the \nimages in these libraries will not meet State requirements. State appropriate authorities should be consulted regarding \nthe suitability of images provided by a manufacturer. \n \n \nAccess rights \n \n11. \nOnly authorized individuals should be permitted to access a TIP system to view and download the data \nand/or schedule various TIP parameters. Access to each of these TIP system components should be strictly controlled, \nand existing TIP systems should use password and identification protection to control such access. Individuals who \nrequire access to a system should be assigned appropriate passwords according to their access requirements in \nadvance of activation of TIP software. For example, X-ray operators should be permitted access only in order to screen \nbaggage using X-ray equipment, and security management should have access to view the TIP data. \n \n12. \nA nominated individual at each airport should keep a full and up-to-date list of users, associated passwords \nand access rights. All passwords should be treated as confidential and controlled on a need-to-know basis. \n \n \nUser databases \n \n13. \nBefore TIP software may be used in an operational environment, user databases should be completed with \nthe details of all individuals who will use and access the system. Such databases enable information regarding detection",
  "725": "Appendix 20 Security equipment and systems \nApp 20-31 \nSensitive Security Information \nDissemination, reproduction or onward distribution of this document is expressly prohibited without the consent of the originators. \n \n \n \nperformance and any attempts to access the system to be linked to appropriate individuals. In general, the following type \nof information is required for each individual: name, airport of work and specific password and/or identification number. \n \n14. \nDifferent makes of TIP systems use different methods for completing databases. For example, some \nsystems require the direct entry of information via the control panel or keyboard on the X-ray equipment, while others \npermit the information to be entered into a computer spreadsheet that is then subsequently loaded into a TIP system. \nOnce a database has been completed, it should be possible to copy it to all other X-ray equipment running TIP software. \nThis facility is particularly useful if numerous screeners use more than one X-ray machine equipped with TIP software. \n \n15. \nDatabases should be modified if new user details are entered or if a password is no longer valid. \n \n \nBriefing and training of operators \n \n16. \nExperience has shown that a significant percentage of screeners express initial concerns about using TIP \nsoftware, because they are unsure of what performance data will be collected and how they will be used. All screeners \nshould be given an opportunity to voice any reservations or concerns they might have, and these should be dealt with \nappropriately. Screeners should understand that the main purpose of TIP software is to optimize performance and to \ngive them some indication of how well they perform, rather than to be used as an enforcement tool. Screeners should \nalso be made aware of the benefits that using TIP will provide, to them and to the security process in general. One \nmethod for reducing screeners\u2019 initial concerns about TIP software is to introduce the software with a generic log-in \npassword and identification number so that when it is first activated, screeners are not required to log in using their \nindividual passwords and/or identification numbers. Once their concerns have been allayed, individual passwords and \nidentification numbers may be issued. \n \n17. \nOperators should be fully briefed and trained on TIP systems prior to using it in an operational environment \nand screeners should fully understand what TIP software does, and not confuse it with automated recognition systems \nused to detect explosives. As far as possible, all operators should be briefed on the software at the same time, in order \nto reduce the likelihood of inaccurate information being passed between staff members. For example, operators often \nwrongly assume that all TIP images will be very complex and that they will be presented almost constantly throughout a \nduty period. An initial briefing should therefore include examples of the types of images that operators will see and some \nidea of the frequency with which these will appear. Operators should understand that, although frequent, the \npresentation of images is unpredictable. \n \n18. \nThere are a number of ways in which TIP software training may be given. TIP simulators can be a useful \noff-line training tool. In addition, training may be conducted using an actual X-ray machine, although this should be \nstrictly supervised. Further information on briefing and training on TIP software can be found in the attachment to this \nAnnex. \n \n \n \nOPERATIONAL USE OF A TIP SYSTEM \n \n \nOperating parameters \n \n19. \nA number of operating parameters, described in Table A20-1, should be scheduled before TIP software \ncan be used, which will determine, for example, the types of images to be presented and the frequency at which they will \nbe presented. State appropriate authorities should have control over these parameters, and individual airports should",

However, it is important that security management and training personnel at \neach airport understand how TIP software works and the various parameters that the civil aviation security policy and \nregulatory sections control. \n \n \nOperator task \n \n20. \nThe introduction of a TIP image does not result in any change to the main purpose of an operator\u2019s task, \nwhich is the detection of prohibited articles. Similarly, there are no changes in the physical appearance of X-ray \nequipment hardware when TIP software is installed. The same control panel is used and all functions operate as normal. \n \n \nTable A20-1.  TIP operating parameters \n \nBag ratio \nThe bag ratio parameter controls the frequency of presentation of TIP images. Specifically, it \nrefers to the frequency of TIP images relative to the number of bags that pass through an X-ray \nmachine. For example, a bag ratio of 1 in 100 means that one TIP image will be presented for \nevery 100 bags. This ratio is set in accordance with baggage throughput at each search facility. \nBag or \ndiversification \nrange \nThe bag range parameter introduces some variation to the bag ratio, in order to prevent \nscreeners from counting bags in order to predict when the next TIP image will be presented. For \ninstance, If the bag ratio is one TIP image for every 100 bags, and the bag range is +/- 40 per \ncent, then a TIP image will be projected between one TIP image per 60 bags and one TIP image \nper 140 bags*. \nRandom ratio \nThe random ratio parameter allows a percentage of scheduled TIP images to be projected \noutside the bag range, i.e. on a random basis. This is intended to keep screeners alert by, for \nexample, occasionally presenting an image in two successive bags*. \nInitial decision \ntime \nA TIP image will be visible for as long as the X-ray image of baggage is visible so that when an \nX-ray image begins scrolling across the viewing monitor screen, an operator typically has four or \nfive seconds in which to respond that a TIP image is present and to stop the image, in order to \nanalyse it further. This initial decision time should therefore be set in accordance with the speed \nof the machine\u2019s conveyor belt. \nThreat decision \ntime \nOnce a screener presses the STOP button within the decision time, additional time is given to \nanalyse the image, often referred to as the threat decision time. The exact setting for this \nparameter may vary, but it will generally fall between 20 and 30 seconds. \nImage selection \nThe percentage of each category of threat item to be presented should be specified, for \nexample, 50 per cent IEDs, 25 per cent guns and 25 per cent knives. Over time these \npercentages may vary to reflect training requirements. It is also possible to select specific \nimages for presentation. Currently it is not possible to control the presentation of a specific TIP \nimage in a particular bag. Therefore, the level of difficulty of any one TIP image will be largely \ndependent on the contents of the passenger baggage in which it is presented. \n* Images presented according to the bag range and random ratio are presented instead of images presented \naccording to the bag ratio, i.e. they are not extra images. Over a period of time, the frequency of TIP images projected \nwill correspond to the bag ratio.",

For this reason, briefing and training of operators on TIP software should be developed around the \nteaching points provided below. All screeners should be given the opportunity to voice any concerns they might have \nabout TIP software and its function, and these concerns should be dealt with appropriately. Before undergoing briefing \nand/or training, screeners should have successfully completed training in the recognition of firearms, explosives, \nincendiary devices and dangerous goods, and be proficient in the use of conventional X-ray equipment. \n \nAIM: \nTo ensure that trainees understand the concept of TIP and are proficient in its use. \n \nOBJECTIVES: \nTrainee to: \n \n1. \nunderstand what TIP is and the context in which it is used; \n \n2. \nunderstand the benefits that TIP can provide; \n \n3. \nbe proficient in the use of TIP software and understand what changes it may introduce to the \nscreening task; and \n \n4. \nunderstand how the TIP system and data will be managed. \n \n \nOBJECTIVE 1: \nWhat is TIP and in what context will it be used? \n \n \nTeaching points: \n \na) \nTIP is a computer software programme installed on X-ray machines to be used in the context of \npassenger cabin baggage screening; \n \nb) \nTIP software is NOT an automated explosive or weapon detection facility; \n \nc) \nthe software projects realistic images of threats onto the X-ray image of baggage; \n \nd) \nthe types of images are selected from a library and include guns, knives and IEDs; \n \ne) \nimages are projected onto all baggage types; \n \nf) \nthe location of TIP images within baggage will vary;",

Dense areas are not necessarily X-ray opaque, although they may be, but, given the degree of absorption of \ndual energy X-rays, with the low energy beam of a dual-beam system being completely blocked, for example, the \ninformation available to the X-ray operator is limited, often significantly so. \n \n3. \nX-ray operators should be aware that there may be occasions when the use of certain image enhancement \nfunctions such as contrast adjustment may elicit more information, but that this cannot be relied on to provide sufficiently \nmeaningful illumination of the area under examination. Operators should clearly understand the value and limitations of \nthe enhancement functions they are using with respect to dense areas and opaque objects, and the need to use caution \nwhen forming a judgement about areas highlighted by a density alert. Operators should consider: \n \na) \nassessing the size of the area or item highlighted by the alert to establish whether it could house or \nshield a prohibited item, in particular an IED. If small areas of alert overlap an organic mass, operators \nshould consider whether such dense areas might shield the components of an IED. It should be \nunderstood that an opaque area not only prevents information on articles behind the area from being \npresented, but also information on articles in front of it. This is because the absorption of the X-ray \nbeam is such that the information on the baggage contents for the entire line of the beam is affected; \nand \n \nb) \nexamining the item from different angles, for instance at 90 degrees from the angle of the original \npresentation of the baggage, which may enable operators to establish the size and shape of the item \nmore clearly. In certain circumstances, a different orientation may improve the penetration of X-rays \nthrough the entire item or parts of the item, allowing an effective assessment. If the size of the area or \nitem is considered insufficient to house or shield a prohibited item, the baggage may be deemed \ncleared. \n \n4. \nIn most cases, the best practice to apply when concerned about a dense area or opaque object is to \nsubject the baggage to further X-ray examination using higher penetration X-rays, or to search the baggage and its \ncontents manually, supplemented by the use of ETD analysis equipment, where available. \n \n \n \n \n\u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013",

Body scanners have been introduced following a Government review of aviation \nsecurity measures to ensure we are taking the most effective action against emerging threats to civil aviation. They \nprovide an additional, less intrusive method of screening passengers quickly and effectively. \n \n\uf0a7 \nWhat is the technology behind the body scanner? The majority of body scanners are based on technology that \nuses millimetre waves. These waves pass through clothing and are reflected off the skin. The waves are reflected \nby other materials such as plastic, metal, wood, iron, ceramics, etc. This is how suspicious objects are identified. \n \n\uf0a7 \nWhat is the procedure for the body scanner? The person being screened walks into the scanning area of the \nbody scanner. A scan is made within a few seconds. The body scanner software analyses the images and indicates, \nwithout intervention from a security officer, whether an object has been detected on the body of the passenger. The \nsecurity officer sees a generic \u201cstick figure\u201d representation on a screen next to the body scanner with boxes \nindicating where the scanner has detected something. No actual picture of the passenger is shown during this \nprocess. If the body scanner detects an object on the body, the passenger is subsequently searched in the area \nwhere the object was detected. If the body scanner does not find any objects, the screen will indicate \u201cclear\u201d and the \npassenger may be allowed to proceed unless any further checks are required. \n \n\uf0a7 \nIs use of the security scan mandatory? (Where opt-outs are allowed) No, normally passengers may choose not \nto go through the body scanner. In such cases, passengers will be subjected to an alternative security screening \nmethod, such as a full manual search. \n \n\uf0a7 \nIs use of the security scan mandatory? (Where no opt-out is permitted) Yes, if selected, you will not be offered \nan alternative method of screening. Refusal to be screened by the body scanner will result in you not being allowed \nto travel. \n \n\uf0a7 \nWhat does the screener see? The security officer sees a generic \u201cstick figure\u201d image of a person on a screen next \nto the body scanner. If the body scanner detects an object on the body, this is indicated by displaying a box on the \nimage in the area where the object has been detected. On the basis of this information, the passenger is subjected \nto a targeted manual search. \n \n\uf0a7 \nCan I view the image that is produced of me by the body scanner? Yes. The image produced is a generic \u201cstick \nfigure\u201d representation, with marks showing where the scanner has detected concealed items. You can see this \nimage as you exit the scanner. No images are saved or retrievable at a later date. \n \n\uf0a7 \nAre the images stored? No, the equipment with automatic detection does not take pictures of persons, but makes \nan analysis on the basis of raw scan data. There are therefore no pictures that could be stored. \n \n\uf0a7 \nIs the body scanner more effective than the existing method of screening? Body scanners are designed to be \neffective against a wide range of possible threat items. They are part of an enhanced response to the terrorist threat \nto aviation and can make a positive contribution to the effectiveness, but also to the efficiency of airport security.",

Body scanners using non-ionising millimetre waves do not penetrate \nthe surface of the skin. Independent testing has shown that millimetre wave technology does not pose any health \nrisks. \n \n\uf0a7 \nIs this the same machine that is used to detect drug swallowers? No, the body scan that is used for that \npurpose uses X-rays to look inside the body for any contraband carried internally. Body scanners only scan the \noutside of the body and do not use X-rays. \n \n\uf0a7 \nIs it comparable to a sonogram? No, sound waves are sent through the body during a sonogram. Body scanners \nonly scan the outside of the body. \n \n\uf0a7 \nIs it similar to an MRI scan? No, an MRI scan looks inside the body. Body scanners only scan the outside of the \nbody. \n \n\uf0a7 \nWhat is the difference between a body scanner, security scanner or millimetre wave scanner? The term \nsecurity scanner is sometimes used to refer to body scanners. The term body scanner is also often used for \nequipment that looks inside the body. The body scanner is a machine that can detect objects carried on the body. \nMillimetre wave is the technology commonly used in body scanners for aviation security. \n \n\uf0a7 \nAre body scanners a method of checking that has been approved by the government? Yes. The [fill in name \nAppropriate Authority], which is responsible for civil aviation security in [name Member State], has granted [name of \nairport] permission to use the body scanner. \n \n\uf0a7 \nDo security officers have to attend special training? Yes, security officers, or screeners, that operate body \nscanners have followed special training. \n \n\uf0a7 \nWhat are the benefits of body scanners? Body scanners are able to detect objects carried or concealed on a \nperson\u2019s body, whether they contain metal or not. In view of the methods used by terrorists, body scanners can \nmake a positive contribution to the effectiveness, but also to the efficiency of airport security. Body scanners are \npopular with both passengers and security staff as their use leads to fewer and less intensive manual searches. \nPassengers are therefore able to pass through screening faster and, it is expected, in a more pleasant and \nconvenient manner. \n \n\uf0a7 \nAm I allowed to pass through the body scanner together with my child? No, only one person at a time is \nallowed to use a body scanner. The waves of body scanners are reflected off of the skin, so stepping into a body \nscanner with a child together means that no clear image can be created. \n \n\uf0a7 \nIs a manual search performed following the scanner? Only if the software registers an alarm, in which case the \nsearch can be limited to the area of the body indicated on the screen. \n \n\uf0a7 \nCan body scanners screener see me in the nude? No, body scanners do not take pictures of passengers. Body \nscanners analyse the scan data and subsequently indicate on a generic \u201cstick figure\u201d representation on the screen \nwhether there is an alarm and if so, where on the passenger\u2019s body an alarm has been indicated. The security \nofficer therefore only sees this representation and decides on the basis thereof to investigate further. \n \n\uf0a7 \nCan I bring anything through the scanner, including my wallet, keys, mobile phone, etc.? No, you will have to \nplace these objects together with your coat in the tray.",

Will this not result in significantly longer queues? The \ncurrent security checks consist of a metal detection gate and, for a portion of the passengers, a manual search. The \nuse body scanners means that fewer passengers need to be subjected to a full manual search. Experience of their \ndeployment elsewhere suggests that passenger throughputs can be comparable to those for more conventional \nsecurity processes. \n \n\uf0a7 \nWill the use of body scanners eliminate the need for performing a manual search? A body scanner does not \nreplace searches altogether, but searches can be more targeted and localized, and their use is expected to lead to \nfewer full searches. \n \n\uf0a7 \nCan all passengers be checked with the aid of a body scanner? Including passengers with, for example, a \npacemaker, prosthetic limb, crutches or those in a wheelchair? Passengers with pacemakers can use body \nscanners without any problems. It is necessary, for the proper operation of the equipment, that the passenger is \nable to stand for several seconds. This will perhaps not always be possible for someone on crutches or in a \nwheelchair. These passengers will be screened by means of a manual search and investigation of the aids, as is \ncurrently already the case during the use of metal detection gates. The makers of certain other medical devices \nsuch as insulin pumps also sometimes advise those who use them not to pass through body scanners. Passengers \nwearing these or other medical devices on the outside of the body such as colostomy bags or prosthetics may also \ntrigger an alarm, in which case this should be resolved with due sensitivity by the security staff. Passengers may \ncarry appropriate documentation to facilitate this.",

Procedures should include background checks of all prospective employees and \nperiodic checks of current employees. Employees should be informed of security policies so that they \ncan recognize deviations from policy and understand the actions to be taken in response to security \nlapses; \n \nc) \nSecurity checks. Visual checks or security controls should be performed by security staff at the first \npoint of entry to the airside. Appropriate checks should be made on all supplies of LAGs to establish \nthat they have been protected from tampering, unless known suppliers have assumed responsibility \nfor applying security controls, and to confirm that they are accompanied by proper documentation; \n \nd) \nBusiness partner security. Aircraft operators and airport retailers should be encouraged to establish an \nunderstanding with LAGs suppliers concerning appropriate security controls for LAGs consignments \nthat are delivered to aircraft operators and retailers. Suppliers should provide written assurances that \nLAGs consignments are properly safeguarded; and \n \ne) \nInformation security. Aircraft operators and airport retailers should establish security policies and \nreasonable procedures to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of data and information used in the \nsupply chain, including protection against misuse and unauthorized access and alteration. \n \n \n \nKNOWN SUPPLIERS OF LAGS AND STEBS \n \n5. \nStates may adopt procedures for known suppliers of LAGs and/or known suppliers of STEBs. As entities \nknown to appropriate aviation security authorities and/or the airport operator, aircraft operators and airport retailers are \nresponsible for ensuring that the chain of security relevant to supplies of LAGs and STEBs is maintained from the first \npoint of entry to the airside until delivery to passengers. Any known supplier of LAGs and/or known supplier of STEBs \nshould also be required to provide a full declaration of the supply chain measures in place, which should be a formal \ndocument signed by the company\u2019s legal representative or official responsible for security and approved by the \nappropriate authorities of the State concerned. Such declarations should be limited in time, and include the appointment \nin writing of the company official responsible for security, as well as confirmation that: \n \na) \nbefore any person is given access to supplies, he or she receives proper security awareness training, \nproviding for an appropriate level of security;",

States wishing to validate the security of LAGs carried on board by transfer passengers who began their \njourney in another State may conduct such validation in a number of ways, including by: \n \na) \nentering into a bilateral arrangement with the State concerned to obtain the necessary assurances of \nadequate security for LAGs and STEBs; \n \nb) \nbecoming a party to a multilateral arrangement whereby such assurances are sought by a regional or \ninternational body on behalf of a number of States; \n \nc) \nseeking direct verification that may include on-site validation of the concerned State\u2019s compliance with \nICAO recommendations with respect to LAGs and STEBs; and/or \n \nd) \naccepting another State\u2019s declaration that it has complied with ICAO recommendations for security \nmeasures for LAGs and STEBs, including their full implementation at airports and by aircraft \noperators. \n \n7. \nValidation of another State\u2019s implementation of security measures for LAGs and STEBs should be based \non a technical assessment of matters related to aviation security and applied in a fair manner. \n \n8. \nConsistent with international practice, a State may elect to require additional measures for LAGs carried by \ntransfer passengers through its airports, over and above those in place in the State where the passengers began their \njourneys or accepted by other parties through an arrangement. Such additional measures might, for example, reflect the \nState\u2019s threat and risk assessment for aviation operations within its territory. \n \n9. \nIn seeking to provide the necessary assurances that appropriate security measures are being implemented, \na State may, on request, wish to share with another State or regional or international body the results of its assessments. \nSuch information sharing may be facilitated by bilateral or multilateral arrangements, if necessary. \n \n10. \nConcerning LAGs in STEBs carried by passengers transiting or transferring through several airports, a \nState may wish to seek confirmation from the State where the purchases were made, as well as from any State through \nwhich passengers may have transited or transferred, that they have applied equally strong controls with respect to LAGs \nand STEBs. \n \n11. \nGiven the critical importance of the security of the supply chain, a State or regional or international body \nmay consider it appropriate to seek agreement from another State concerning on-site validation of the effectiveness of \nits security measures, either directly or through an approved third party. If permission for such validation is granted, the \nparties should establish in advance the terms and scope of the process of validation, including the secure handling of \nsensitive information.",

In order to satisfy the requirements for such an exemption, passengers or staff members are required to provide \nwritten proof of authenticity for the exempted LAGs. \n \n20. \nThe procedures to follow in order to determine whether an exemption is warranted are described below. As \npassengers may be concerned about their medicines, it may be necessary for security staff to handle such articles with \nsensitivity. If, once the procedures below have been followed, doubts remain as to the admissibility of a liquid, aerosol or \ngel, the item in question should not be allowed beyond the screening checkpoint. Since the liquid, aerosol or gel is \nregarded as essential by the passenger, it follows in this case that the passenger should be advised not to fly. \n \n21. \nExemptions may be granted if a liquid, aerosol or gel is to be used during the journey and is either required \nfor medical purposes or for meeting a special dietary requirement, such as food for a baby. If required, passengers \nshould provide proof of authenticity of the exempted liquid, aerosol or gel. Further details on exemption requirements are \nas follows: \n \na) \nLAGs needed during the journey.

The passenger should be asked why the excess \nquantity is needed and whether it may not be placed in the aircraft hold. The excess LAGs should be \npermitted in the cabin only if the responses to these questions provide the necessary assurance; \n \nb) \nLAGs required for medical purposes. Medicines with a total volume exceeding 100 ml, whether \nprescribed by a doctor or acquired over the counter, may be acceptable if it is indeed essential to carry \nthem in the cabin and the amount to be carried is no more than is necessary for the journey. The \npassenger should be questioned on the nature of the medicine, why it is considered essential, and the \namount and frequency of the dosage. In principle, however, staff should be less tolerant of excessive \nquantities of over-the-counter medicines such as nose sprays and cough syrups as these are not life- \nor-death medicines. Substances that are not medicines but are used for medical purposes are \npermitted, such as ice that is used to maintain the temperature of a transplant organ, blood or blood \nproducts, and even beverages if their use is justified on medical grounds, for instance an autistic \ntraveller who needs to have a particular brand of drink; \n \nc) \nSpecial dietary requirements. Liquids or foods that are essential for a passenger\u2019s health include baby \nfood, provided that a baby is travelling, or special foods required by lactose- or gluten-intolerant \npassengers. Other baby products may include wet wipes, milk or juice, sterilized water, and meals in \nliquid, gel or paste form. If the volume of baby food is deemed excessive, the full quantity should not \nbe permitted through the screening checkpoint; and \n \nd) \nProof of authenticity. Passengers should provide proof of authenticity of exempted LAGs on request. \nStaff should verify that the name on the label of prescription medication matches the name on the \nboarding pass. In the case of over-the-counter medication, a determination should be made on \nreasonable amounts, which includes what is required for the length of the flight, taking into account \npossible delays and flight diversions. If there are doubts about the quantity of a liquid, aerosol or gel \ncarried by a passenger or the passenger\u2019s medical or special dietary needs, a plausibility check \nshould be performed. The passenger may be invited to sample the item or rub it on his or her skin to \nprove that it is safe. Hydrogen peroxide-based explosives, for instance, are caustic and cannot be \nsafely tasted or rubbed on the skin. In the case of prescribed medication, the passenger should be \nable to produce a note from the doctor if the container\u2019s label does not list the patient\u2019s name. The \nfollowing aspects should be taken into consideration when verifying proof of authenticity: \n \n1) \npassengers should not be asked to taste medication if the usage instructions or doctor\u2019s advice \nindicates that it would be dangerous to do so; \n \n2) \npassengers should not be made to taste any medication, either their own or their child\u2019s, against \ntheir wishes; \n \n3) \nfor children\u2019s prescription medication, the accompanying adult passenger should not be asked to \ntaste the medicine. Instead, verification should be sought through questioning; \n \n4) \nif a container is marked in grams, it may be assumed that 100 g corresponds to 100 ml; and \n \n5) \nif a passenger is asked to rub a small amount of a substance on his or her skin, the passenger\u2019s \nskin should be monitored for at least two minutes to see if there is a reaction.",

Threats may be related to the nature of the company\u2019s business, the location of \nits operations, or its nationality, as well as the State of aircraft registration, a passenger\u2019s profile or the value of goods \ncarried. Information on the various kinds of threats facing an operator comes from a variety of sources; in developing \nand maintaining a current threat assessment for different operational areas, flight department managers should rely on \nthe following resources, as appropriate: \n \na) \nnational and local security officials; \n \nb) \nnational and local law enforcement officials; \n \nc) \nthe company security officer, if applicable; \n \nd) \nnational and international trade associations; \n \ne) \nair security assessment and intelligence service providers; \n \nf) \nlocal and foreign media reports; and \n \ng) \ncompany officials posted in foreign locations, if applicable. \n \n3. \nSecurity professionals may provide assistance in determining and assessing flight department \nvulnerabilities. \n \n \n \nPREVENTIVE SECURITY MEASURES \n \n4. \nThe focus of preventive security measures is on: \n \nSensitive Security Information \nDissemination, reproduction or onward distribution of this document is expressly prohibited without the consent of the originators. \n \nApp 25-1",

  "799": "Appendix 27 \nSURFACE-TO-AIR MISSILES \n \nGENERAL \n \n1. \nAttacks on aircraft engaged in civil air transport by surface-to-air missiles, or man-portable air defence \nsystems (MANPADS), have been rare but are not unknown. Successful defence against such an attack is difficult but \nnot impossible and depends on close cooperation and coordination between ground forces, operators, flight crew and \nATS. \n \n2. \nSuccessful defence depends, in the first instance, on an appreciation of a weapon and its capabilities and \nlimitations. Most such weapons are infra-red guided missiles, and operators have several functions to perform for the \nsuccessful launch of this type of missile, including: \n \na) \nidentification of the target; \n \nb) \naiming of the missile, and often energizing an operating battery at the same time; \n \nc) \nallowing sufficient time for the missile guidance system to lock on to the target; and \n \nd) \nlaunching of the missile. \n \n3. \nSuch missiles are generally simple to operate, requiring only that the operator be able to see the target and \noperate the power system and launching mechanism. However, training is required if an operator wishes to make \noptimum use of the system, and it is not unusual for an untrained or poorly trained operator to wrongly estimate target \nrange and fire the missile at a target which is outside the launch success zone. In addition, there are a number of \nlimitations which are imposed on the operation, including: \n \na) \ntime taken by the operator to prepare, aim, energize and launch the weapon; \n \nb) \nlife of the operating battery, which is often comparatively short; \n \nc) \nthe fact that the weapon may have no gravity bias and therefore must be launched at an angle of more \nthan 20 degrees elevation; \n \nd) \na sufficient level of radiated energy, often required to activate the guidance system; \n \ne) \nstrong solar reflection, often required to activate the guidance system if a suitable heat source is not \navailable as the target; \n \nf) \nfavourable weather conditions required for a successful launch; \n \ng) \nlimited slant range of about 4 500 m (15 000 ft); \n \nSensitive Security Information \nDissemination, reproduction or onward distribution of this document is expressly prohibited without the consent of the originators. \n \nApp 27-1",

As specified in Annex 17, screening and other security controls are to be applied by entities that are approved by \nthe appropriate authority, defined as regulated agents (RA) and known consignors (KC). A secure supply chain leads to \na more efficient flow of cargo and provides a solution for those consignments that are difficult to screen with traditional \nequipment. \n \n4. \nThe WCO\u2019s SAFE Framework of Standards (SAFE FoS) defines an Authorized Supply Chain as a concept \nunder which all participants in an international trade transaction are approved by customs as observing specified \nstandards in the secure handling of goods and relevant information. Those participants are called Authorized Economic \nOperators (AEOs). AEO has become a flagship programme for WCO Members as it offers an opportunity for customs to \nshare its security responsibilities with stakeholders, while at the same time rewarding them with a number of additional \nfacilitation benefits. Partnership programmes with trade allow customs to achieve more with existing resources and aim \nat ensuring sustainable and long-term compliance through several additional incentives. \n \n5. \nWhile there are differences between these two systems, there are many similarities too. The WCO and \nICAO have collaborated to enhance cooperation between customs and AVSEC authorities and promote alignment and \nsynergies between both supply chain security programmes. This should ultimately lead to simplification of procedures \nand the eradication of duplicative security requirements and controls, to the benefit of authorities and industry. \n \n6. \nThe Aviation Security Manual includes guidance on the approval of entities that hold or seek the AEO \nstatus as RA or KC. In Standard 3, Pillar 3 of its SAFE FoS, the WCO encourages the alignment of the various \nprogrammes that are in place to enhance the security of the international supply chain. Cooperation may include areas \nsuch as the application and initial assessment procedure, exchange of available and appropriate information of the \napplicant, and alignment of compliance and follow-up activities after the status/authorization has been granted. \nFurthermore, some national and regional authorities have enshrined the principle of alignment in their legislation.",

  "822": "App 30-6 \nAviation Security Manual \nSensitive Security Information \nDissemination, reproduction or onward distribution of this document is expressly prohibited without the consent of the originators. \n \n \n \n \n \nStep 1: Ensure there is political will and executive commitment for the alignment \n \n12. \nAn alignment process requires time and resources, and changes in legislation may be necessary. This can \nonly be done if there is political will to do so, from both customs and AVSEC perspectives. Both authorities need to be \nequally involved at the political level, but also at the management and technical expert levels. \n \n13. \nThe authorities involved may consider formally recording expressed intention and the arrangements made, \nfor instance in an agreement, Memorandum of Understanding or exchange of letters. \n \n \nStep 2: Ensure compliance with Annex 17 and the WCO SAFE FoS \n \n14. \nWCO and ICAO Members that intend to align their Customs and AVSEC supply chain programmes should \nensure that their respective programmes are compliant with the WCO SAFE FoS and Annex 17, respectively. \nDeficiencies relating to a State\u2019s RA and/or KC programme that were identified during a previous ICAO Aviation Security \nAudit, if any, should have been rectified. \n \n \nStep 3: Establish a project team, define a reasonable and workable timeline and agree on deliverables \n \n15. \nThe project team should consist of experts from both the customs and the Aviation Security authorities. \nTeam members should be knowledgeable on all aspects of AEO and RA/KC, respectively, including the approval \nprocess, security requirements and oversight mechanisms. Depending on how the authorities are organized, it may be \nnecessary to include experts from different branches (e.g. both policy and operational experts). \n \n16. \nAn agreed timeline and deliverables will contribute to streamlining the process. \n \n \nStep 4: Exchange legislation and gain understanding of each other\u2019s processes \n \n17. \nThe comparison and assessment (see steps 5 and 6) of both programmes are key elements of the \nalignment process. For this to be carried out, exchange of all relevant national and international legislation is essential. \n \n18. \nTo ensure understanding of the legislation and the relevant processes, the members of the project team \nmay give presentations on their own field of expertise and invite the other experts to join on site audits or verifications. \n \n19. \nAt this stage, the project team may also involve representatives of industry associations, as well as some \nalready accredited AEOs and RAs or KCs. The experience of entities that participate in both secure supply chain \nprogrammes may be beneficial in understanding them and can provide useful insights on how alignment could benefit \nthe industry. \n \n \nStep 5: Conduct a paper comparison of the legislation \n \n20. \nBy using a comparison table, the national legislations of both programmes can be assessed.

In this case, it should \nbe ensured that all the requirements of the other programme are taken into account as well and not only those that exist \nin the first programme. The second option is to compare both programmes against a predefined set of elements based \non the respective WCO and ICAO standards and requirements. \n \n22. \nWhen carrying out the comparison, attention should be given to the fact that similar requirements may be \nworded differently in both programmes and that similar wording may have different meanings. \n \n \nStep 6: Assess the compatibility of both programmes \n \n23. \nThe paper comparison gives clarity as to which requirements exist in each national programme. With this \ninformation, an assessment can be made on the similarities and differences in both programmes and whether any \ndifferences would or could be a barrier to aligning the programmes. \n \n24. \nThe assessment should not be made on the programmes as a whole, but focus on single elements.

It is therefore recommended to confirm the assessment by conducting a practical comparison in the form \nof a joint validation exercise. \n \n27. \nThe combined project team could jointly visit an entity that is both an AEO and a RA or KC to verify its \nfindings. The project team may also choose to involve industry associations directly in the verification process and make \nuse of their experiences and expertise. \n \n28. \nWhere necessary, the paper comparison and/or assessment should be adjusted. \n \n \nStep 8: Establish conclusions on possible ways of alignment and seek political support \n \n29. \nBased on the assessment, the project team should conclude which ways of alignment are possible, which \nways are desirable, and what is needed to achieve alignment.

Further, assignment to ATS units of the \nresponsibility for compiling non-air traffic services information, at a time when ATS units may be carrying a maximum \nworkload, is undesirable. Primary responsibility for the collation and dissemination of the information required for security \npurposes should therefore be assigned to a designated round-the-clock security service. \n \n6. \nHowever, ATS units and the operator involved should be required to assist, to the extent feasible, in the \ncollation of the required information. The operator\u2019s communications capability should be used if it is the fastest means \navailable. Assignment of responsibility at this level, in the following manner, is appropriate: \n \na) \noperator \u2013 to provide all available pertinent details that are not contained in the flight plan (e.g. what \nmeans of secondary communications are available to contact the flight deck; and whether or not the \nflight deck has been breached); \n \nb) \nATS units \u2013 to provide all ATS information available, assisting, when possible, in obtaining from the \nPIC such other information as is required; and \n \nc) \ndesignated security services \u2013 to collect, compile and collate all of the required information, including \nspecialist advice requested by the PIC, and to immediately transmit such information by the fastest \navailable means to other security services likely to be affected and to the PIC when deemed \nnecessary or desirable, at the same time informing the appropriate authority for security of the action \ntaken. \n \n7. \nA number of variable factors will determine whether or not the required information is available in the first \ninstance from the operator, ATS units or security services, including: \n \na) \nwhen, where and under what circumstances the unlawful act first became known; \n \nb) \nwhat, if any, communication with the flight crew and/or offenders has been possible or permitted; \n \nc) \nif the expected or required two-way communications between air traffic control and the aircraft have \nbeen lost; and \n \nd) \nrole of the operator, particularly in those cases where the operator: \n \n1) \nis not represented at the aerodrome of most recent landing; or \n \n2) \nhas not participated in servicing the aircraft.",

Therefore, the ATS unit which first becomes aware of an aircraft being subjected to an act of unlawful \ninterference should transmit an initial alerting message containing all available pertinent information to those ATS units \nwhich might be affected, with regard to the fuel endurance of the aircraft, the possibility of sudden changes in destination \nand other relevant factors. \n \n9. \nAs the flight progresses, ATS units should transmit updated information required for ATS and search and \nrescue purposes in accordance with Annex 11 and the Procedures for Air Navigation Services \u2013 Air Traffic Management \n(Doc 4444), which contain the requirements for ATS units to forward such information. \n \n10. \nAt the same time, security services in the States concerned should collect and transmit all available \npertinent information to security services at the aircraft\u2019s known or suspected destination and in States expected to be \noverflown. \n \n \n \nSUMMARY OF TYPICAL ACTIONS \n \n11. \nThe following is a summary of the series of actions to consider taking in order to meet the objective (note \nthat these actions should be part of a crisis management plan): \n \na) \nthe ATS unit informs the designated security services and operator immediately when it is known, \nobserved or suspected that an aircraft has been subjected to an act of unlawful interference; \n \nb) \nif communications have been lost with the aircraft, the State of the airspace within which the aircraft is \ncurrently flying should invoke its contingency plans for dealing with such an incident. This will usually \ninvolve informing and possibly mobilizing military aviation assets; \n \nc) \nif the aircraft is diverted from its original route and its destination is unknown, the ATS unit, using the \navailable flight plan details and all other reliable information, attempts to determine the actual or \nsuspected route(s), contacting the flight deck and PIC if possible, and/or destination and notify the \ndesignated security services and operator accordingly; \n \nd) \nthe ATS unit transmits an alerting message to all ATS units that might be concerned with the flight, \ngiving such details as are available; \n \ne) \nthe ATS unit requests supplementary flight plan data from the unit at the airport of departure; \n \nf) \nthe operator assists in providing the required information to the designated security services; \n \ng) \ndesignated security services collect and transmit all the data required, as specified in paragraph 9; \n \nh) \nthese procedures are repeated as required during the flight;",

  "873": "Appendix 37 \n \nTHREAT AND RISK ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGY \n \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \n1. \nAnnex 17 requires a State to constantly review the nature of the threat to civil aviation operations within its \nterritory and airspace above, and adjust relevant elements of its NCASP accordingly. The terms \u201crisk assessment\u201d and \n\u201csecurity risk assessment\u201d appear in Annex 17 in several Standards. This reflects the fact that Annex 17 represents a set \nof SARPs below which level international aviation security must not be allowed to fall; but as SARPs may lag behind risk \nposed by a specific threat that they intend to address, States should base their risk assessment on a robust \nmethodology and on an evidence-based sense of the risk environment, especially in cases where the Annex 17 SARPs \nspecifically call for a risk assessment. The risk assessment should be maintained regularly to ensure that it is up-to-date, \naccurate and complete at all times. \n \n2. \nOne of the most difficult tasks for aviation security professionals is devising an effective security plan that \ncorrelates to the risks posed by a threat against civil aviation. Accurately identifying threats should be the first step in the \nprocess. \n \n3. \nA risk assessment method, which also includes a process map, is described in this appendix. This method \nshould assist States and relevant authorities in carrying out their own risk assessment of possible and/or potential \nconcerns and threats in a logical, consistent and clear manner. The same methodology is used by the ICAO Aviation \nSecurity Global Risk Context Statement (Doc 10108 \u2013 Restricted), which serves as a tool for developing evidence-based \nrisk assessments and modifying possible mitigation actions that States may implement to achieve risk-based security \nprogrammes. \n \n4. \nIt is readily acknowledged that the responsibility for assessing the nature and level of threat to civil aviation \nwithin a State may be delegated to another entity, such as an intelligence service or a military component, and not to the \nCAA. This guidance material is therefore provided primarily to assist States in meeting their requirements under \nAnnex 17 if they have no other usable threat and risk assessment process for civil aviation. The relevant authority \nresponsible for threat and risk assessment should consider adapting this model as necessary to fit a State\u2019s particular \ncircumstances. \n \nNote.\u2014 Guidance on the sharing of information pertaining to conflict zones can be found in the ICAO Risk \nAssessment Manual for Civil Aircraft Operations Over or Near Conflict Zones (Doc 10084). \n \n \n \nRISK ASSESSMENT METHOD AND PROCESS MAP \n \n5. \nThe risk assessment method described in this appendix is comparable to existing good practice for risk \nmanagement systems, adapted to take account of the particular issues associated with the threat from terrorism. The \nrisk assessment process comprises three elements as follows: \n \n \nSensitive Security Information \nDissemination, reproduction or onward distribution of this document is expressly prohibited without the consent of the originators. \n \nApp 37-1",

This should be sufficiently detailed to permit \naccurate assessment and analysis; \u201can attack against an aircraft\u201d is not good enough as a scenario; \n \nb) \nlikelihood of an attack \u2013 the probability or likelihood of that attack being attempted, based on \nperpetrators\u2019 intentions and capabilities but NOT taking into account current security measures. \nLikelihood is utilized as an indicator of threat, considering both the intent and capability of a \nperpetrator to carry out a threat scenario; \n \nc) \nconsequences \u2013 the nature and scale of the impact of the specific attack, in human, economic, \npolitical, and reputational terms under a reasonable worst-case scenario; \n \nd) \ncurrent mitigation measures \u2013 the relevant SARPs, which may not all be in Annex 17, and guidance \u2013 \nboth of which are assumed to be effectively implemented (where that is clearly not the case, the \nresidual risk will be higher). It is assumed that no threat can be entirely eliminated; \n \ne) \nvulnerability \u2013 the extent of the remaining vulnerabilities once the current mitigating measures have \nbeen taken into account; \n \nf) \nresidual risk \u2013 the overall risk of a successful attack, taking into account the likelihood and \nconsequences of the threat scenario, and considering the remaining vulnerabilities after assuming \ncurrent mitigating measures have been implemented; and \n \ng) \npossible additional mitigation \u2013identified measures, not formally included in ICAO SARPs, that could \nbe implemented to further mitigate residual risks where necessary. \n \n7. \nIt is important that the risk assessment identify the possible or potential scenarios carefully, being specific \nand thorough in considering each form of threat. Threats could be directed at specific airports, terminals or aviation \ninfrastructure, such as aviation fuel farms, air traffic control facilities or navigational equipment, as well as aircraft, \nincluding different forms of aviation, such as general aviation, passenger aircraft and cargo-only aircraft. The means and \nmethods by which a threat could be carried out should also be evaluated. This would include how a weapon or explosive \ndevice could be constructed or concealed, the means by which it might be conveyed (e.g. whether person- or vehicle- \nborne) and by whom (e.g. insider, passenger, or non-travelling person), how it could be concealed, and how it could be \nactivated or utilized in order to perpetrate an act of unlawful interference. \n \n8. \nLikelihood, consequences and vulnerability may be scored on a ten-point scale from HIGH to LOW.

The ranking is derived from the other scores, and it \ninvolves some elements of judgement as well as the aggregation of the scores assigned to likelihood, consequences \nand vulnerability. Scores assigned to each of the aforementioned parameters reflect a consensual analysis based on the \ninformation currently available \u2013 reflecting the fact that there is generally limited data to draw upon.

If, after this review, any of the parameter assessments are \nmodified, the mathematical formula should be applied again using the updated scores. \n \n14. \nFigure A37-1 illustrates the threat and risk assessment process, which starts by identifying the threat and \nthen determines the associated residual risk. The following steps consist of designing and implementing appropriate \nmitigating measures in order to lower that residual risk to an acceptable level.

States should adopt a \nsimilar approach in developing their own security risk assessments. For instance, in considering a threat category such \nas a person-borne IED used to attack aircraft, those conducting an assessment should consider, separately, both a \npassenger-borne IED used to attack aircraft and a person-borne IED introduced by crew and/or employees and used to \nattack aircraft. It is easy to see how the risk from a particular threat may differ when one considers an insider, such as an \naircraft operator staff member or a passenger, as the means of introducing a threat. For example: \n \na) \nthe vulnerability associated with insiders might be considered greater if they have access to the last \nlayer of security in a way that a passenger does not; \n \nb) \nthe likelihood associated with insiders might be greater if they are deemed to have more opportunities \nthan passengers; \n \nc) \nthe consequence of a threat associated with insiders might be greater if an insider has access deeper \nwithin the system. For instance, an insider could perpetrate a more credible and thus more disruptive \nhoax; and \n \nd) \nthe mitigations may be different, e.g. more stringent background checks and vetting for staff members. \n \n16. \nIn summary, the method should involve considering each role within the system and whether it offers a \nparticular tactical advantage in relation to each threat type or whether it poses the same issues as passengers. In \napplying this methodology, it is possible to consider insider vulnerabilities as part of an integrated risk assessment.",

Threat assessors should be appropriately trained. \nEach aircraft operator and airport should have at least one assessor on duty or on call at all times. If a threat is received \nagainst an aircraft on the ground, the targeted aircraft operator and the appropriate airport security services should \nagree on assessment drawing on other stakeholders such as the police, the intelligence services and appropriate \nauthority for security as necessary. \n \n4. \nAircraft operators may require the PIC to refer threats received on board aircraft in flight to operational staff \non the ground for assessment, or they may authorize the PICs to assess threats themselves. If PICs are authorized to \nassess threats, they should be appropriately trained and also be in a positon to receive assistance and information from \nlaw enforcement or State security services. \n \n5. \nThreat assessors should obtain full details of each threat message, ideally in the form of a completed \nthreat report form from the person who received the threat, by the fastest possible means. A sample form is provided in \nAttachment A to Appendix 38.",

If PICs are \nauthorized to assess threats, aircraft operators should provide them with training and guidance to enable them to assess \nthe threat and decide on a course of action, liaising with the ground-based authorities who may have more information. \nThe following should be considered: \n \na) \ncircumstances surrounding the threat, to determine whether it originated before the aircraft\u2019s departure \nor during flight. PICs should consider whether the threat could have been discovered during the \npreflight search of the aircraft, or at an earlier stage of the flight; \n \nb) \nprecise wording of the threat, to determine whether it suggests a credible reason for the threat having \nbeen made. A threat is most likely to be genuine if there is a reason, such as a desire to avoid the \ncasualties that would result from an explosion. It is likely that a person issuing such a threat will seek \nto ensure that it is received and that there is time to react to it.

The \nroute to the nominated nearest suitable airfield should be as direct as possible but avoid densely \npopulated areas; \n \nb) \nif the aircraft is required to make an approach to land over a densely populated area, it should be \npermitted to land at that airfield in accordance with current emergency procedures. Time in the air \nshould not be prolonged in order to divert to another airfield; \n \nc) \nif an immediate landing cannot be made, consideration should be given to seeking expert advice \nby radio communication with the ATS unit or other ground station which should, in turn, provide a \nlandline link with State explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) experts. The possibility of \nradio communications being monitored, with the attendant risk of compromise, should be taken into \naccount during transmissions.

Nevertheless, if the device is to be moved, the following actions should be taken: \n \na) \nthe object should not be opened; \n \nb) \na check should be made to ensure that the object is free to move, ensuring, for example, that there is \nno thread joining it to the aircraft structure, which may indicate an anti-handling triggering mechanism; \n \nc) \nthe object should be moved gently and kept in the same attitude in which it was found; and \n \nd) \nthe object should be placed, in the same attitude, in the prepared least-risk bomb location, packed \naround as described above and suitably restrained against movement during flight or during \ndeceleration or landing. \n \n10. \nNo procedures which involve disconnecting or cutting electrical circuits in a suspect object should be \nattempted. As a general rule, a suspect object should not be jettisoned from aircraft in flight, particularly through a dorso- \nlateral door, emergency exit or hatch, as this can subject the object to severe buffeting by the airflow and cause an \nexplosion in close proximity to the aircraft fuselage or engine(s), resulting in a loss of control and possible destruction of \naircraft. \n \n11. \nIf no suspicious object is found and an immediate landing cannot be made, the PIC should consider the \nfollowing: \n \na) \nalthough a bomb threat may have been received and assessed as RED, the aircraft should be flown \nas normally as possible, striking a balance between the need for a rapid landing and the risk arising \nfrom undue haste; \n \nb) \nan emergency should be declared and the aircraft should divert to the nearest suitable airfield. The \nchoice of airfield should take into account landing performance requirements, approach aids, \nemergency facilities and the proximity of approach paths to densely populated areas; \n \nc) \nthe ATS unit should be fully briefed on flight intentions so that the appropriate ground measures can \nbe initiated at the airfield of intended landing; \n \nd) \ncabin crew should be briefed to be prepared for a possible emergency landing and for the possible \nuse of crew oxygen and/or smoke masks; \n \ne) \nif operationally possible, cabin differential pressure should be reduced to zero by descending the \naircraft to cabin altitude, which should not be raised and should be maintained until the top of descent. \nIf the minimum safe altitude and range considerations permit, the aircraft should descend to below \n3 000 m (10 000 ft); \n \nf) \nall efforts should be taken to minimize aircraft manoeuvres and to try to avoid turbulence; \n \ng) \ncareful consideration should be given to the choice between flying faster to minimize airborne time and \nflying slowly to minimize air loads and damage in the event of fuselage rupture.

  "893": "Appendix 39 \n \nAIRCRAFT SECURITY SEARCH CHECKLIST \n \n \n1. \nRegular search of aircraft for suspect explosive devices and weapons may be conducted prior to \ncommencing each flight, based on a risk assessment conducted by the appropriate authority. A similar search is \nrequired when an aircraft is suspected of being the target of an act of unlawful interference. The difference between the \ntwo types is only in the degree and thoroughness of the search undertaken, and these will be dictated by the total \ncircumstances applicable to each situation. \n \n2. \nThe large number of aircraft in service throughout the world makes it impossible to provide guidance for \nrecommended aircraft inspection procedures that will be adequate in all cases. Aircraft operators should develop an \naircraft search procedure checklist for each type of aircraft in service and include this checklist as part of flight crew \nsecurity kits. Use of such a checklist by ground crews is particularly helpful at locations where the only persons familiar \nwith the particular type or configuration of aircraft are flight crew compartment and cabin crew members. \n \n3. \nAn isolated aircraft parking position may be the best location at an airport in which to search an aircraft \nsubjected to a specific threat, but contingency plans should recognize that it may not always be possible to access this \nlocation. \n \n4. \nAircraft searches should be carried out in good lighting conditions. This may require the use of auxiliary \npower units or the attachment of ground power lines to an aircraft. \n \n5. \nTo avoid duplication of effort, a search of an aircraft should be conducted systematically by staff familiar \nwith the particular aircraft, provided with a checklist and assigned to specific areas of the aircraft. Attention should be \ngiven to those areas to which passengers have had access, such as main cabins, galley areas and toilets, but a search \nshould also include the flight crew compartment exterior and cargo holds. \n \n6. \nControl of access to the aircraft should be imposed before starting a search, which should be carried out \nwith the minimum number of persons on board. Control of access is necessary in order to ensure that devices are not \nintroduced into an aircraft once it has been cleared, and should be maintained until aircraft doors are closed prior to \npush back. \n \n7. \nSearchers should be briefed not to touch suspicious objects but to notify the search coordinator, mark the \nlocation with a prominent object not touching the device, and withdraw from the immediate area to await further \ninstructions. If a suspect device is discovered, the possibility of secondary devices should not be discounted. \n \n8. \nHand-held communications are useful for coordination of a search and are often the only way of ensuring \nappropriate and rapid lifesaving procedures for search and evacuation. However, if a suspect device has been located, \nthose using hand-held communications should immediately move away and ensure that they and anyone else in the \narea move outside the cordon as quickly as possible.

By training staff to follow these four steps \nin conjunction with local contingency plans, a safe conclusion to an incident, with minimum loss of life, may be achieved \nin most circumstances. The four steps and the order in which they should be executed are as follows: \n \na) \nconfirm; \n \nb) \nclear; \n \nc) \ncordon; and \n \nd) \ncontrol. \n \n \n \nCONFIRM \n \n2. \nConfirm that the object found should actually be reported as a suspect explosive device. Check for labels \nor tags giving possible information of the owner. Do not attempt to move the object in order to gain better access to it \nsince it may be equipped with an anti-handling device that may cause it to detonate. \n \n3. \nEliminate the possibility that the suspect object is private property, such as crew baggage, left unattended \nby anyone in the immediate area. Do not take too long in carrying out this action since the device may be on a timer or \nable to be detonated by remote control. \n \n4. \nNote its exact location. Make brief notes of its appearance and mark its position, if necessary, with a \ndistinct item to assist police or EOD staff in identifying the object on their arrival. \n \n5. \nAssess the validity and likelihood of the suspect object being in that particular location. Ask whether the: \n \na) \nobject is placed in a position to kill personnel or destroy resources; and \n \nb) \ntarget is valuable, vital, attractive or under threat from possible attack. \n \n6. \nOnce satisfied that the suspect object could be an explosive device, carry out the next three steps and take \nthe necessary actions as defined in local contingency plans. \n \n7. \nIf in any doubt, treat as a suspect explosive device. \n \nSensitive Security Information \nDissemination, reproduction or onward distribution of this document is expressly prohibited without the consent of the originators. \n \nApp 40-1",
  "904": "App 40-2 \nAviation Security Manual \nSensitive Security Information \nDissemination, reproduction or onward distribution of this document is expressly prohibited without the consent of the originators. \n \n \n \n \nCLEAR \n \n8. \nClear all persons, including any search teams, from the immediate area of the suspect device. A minimum \ninitial distance of 100 m should be achieved, but the actual circumstances, i.e. the presence of large areas of glass or \nflammable or explosive substances in the vicinity of the device, the possibility of building collapse, or local contingency \nplans, may dictate a larger distance. \n \n9. \nAt the same time, ensure that relevant duty personnel such as the airport security officer or duty airport \nofficer are notified about the suspect device according to local contingency plans. \n \n \n \nCORDON \n \n10. \nEstablish a cordon to prevent anyone from gaining access to the area. The size of the cordon will depend \non the site of the incident, the size of the suspect device and the protection of cordon personnel. A good baseline is to \nensure that cordon personnel are out of line of sight of the device. \n \n11. \nEstablish one cordon entry point and ensure that nobody approaches the device unless authorized by the \nincident commander. It is not unusual for senior management and other persons to insist that they should view the \ndevice in order to give a second opinion, but they should be politely denied access until EOD experts have arrived and \nconfirm that it is safe to do so. \n \n12. \nPolice may deploy a further outer cordon on access routes in order to ensure safe evacuation and the \nrapid arrival of emergency services. \n \n \n \nCONTROL \n \n13. \nEstablish an incident control point as the central control area for the incident, until police or specialized \nstaff arrive on the scene and take command. Relevant personnel should be informed according to local contingency \nplans about the suspect device, if they have not already been informed. The persons who discovered the device should \nremain in order to assist police and EOD experts. The police should assume control on their arrival and dictate further \nactions as necessary. \n \n14. \nNominate a rendezvous point outside the cordon for all other agencies that will be arriving at the incident. \nFollow further local procedures or instructions for suspect explosive device incidents. \n \n15. \nEmergency services such as fire and ambulance crews should stand by at the rendezvous point outside \nthe cordon to deal with the results of any explosion or fire. \n \n16. \nIn the event of an explosion, first aid should be rendered immediately to injured personnel, followed by the \nimplementation of established damage control procedures. \n \n17. \nAfter the effects of the explosion are under control, the search should be continued in case there are \nsecondary explosive devices.",

  "907": "Appendix 41 \n \nSEARCH AND EVACUATION GUIDELINES \n \n \nGENERAL PRINCIPLES \n \n1. \nFor searches to be effective, they should be conducted systematically, by staff familiar with the area \nconcerned, since outside personnel are unlikely to know the layout of the aircraft or terminal building concerned, and the \nvarious places in which a device could be concealed and, therefore, will not so readily note anything that is out of place \nor unfamiliar. Search plans should be prepared in advance and staff trained to use them. A search coordinator should be \nassigned to provide control of the search process and, if necessary, make the decision to evacuate. \n \n2. \nSearchers should be briefed not to touch suspicious objects but to notify the search coordinator, mark the \nlocation with a prominent object not touching the device, and withdraw from the immediate area to await further \ninstructions. If a suspect device is discovered, the possibility of secondary devices should not be discounted. \n \n3. \nHand-held communications are useful for coordination of a search and are often the only way of ensuring \nappropriate and rapid lifesaving procedures for search and evacuation. However, if a suspect device has been located, \nthose using hand-held communications should immediately move away and ensure that they and anyone else in the \narea move outside the cordon as quickly as possible. Radios should not be used to transmit within 25 m of a suspect \ndevice. \n \n4. \nControl of access should be imposed before starting a search, in order to ensure that devices are not \nintroduced into the area once it has been cleared. Searches should be carried out with the minimum number of persons \non board. \n \n5. \nEffective and systematic searching takes time. If the warning received indicates a possible detonation time \nfor the device, which will prevent a thorough search being conducted, the best and safest option is to evacuate all \npersonnel to a safe area and wait for the arrival of specialist EOD personnel. \n \n \n \nINITIATION OF A SEARCH \n \n6. \nThe coordinator may initiate a search by: \n \na) \nsending a message to the search teams over a public address system. This message should be \ncoded to avoid unnecessary disruption and alarm to the public; \n \nb) \nusing personal radios, pagers or mobile and/or cellular telephones; or \n \nc) \nusing a telephone cascade system whereby the coordinator calls, for example, three members, who in \nturn each call a further three members and so on until all teams have been alerted. \n \n \nSensitive Security Information \nDissemination, reproduction or onward distribution of this document is expressly prohibited without the consent of the originators. \n \nApp 41-1",
  "908": "App 41-2 \nAviation Security Manual \nSensitive Security Information \nDissemination, reproduction or onward distribution of this document is expressly prohibited without the consent of the originators. \n \n \n \n \nWHAT SEARCHERS SHOULD BE LOOKING FOR \n \n7. \nIt is difficult to give guidance to search teams about the appearance of suspect explosive devices as they \ncan be disguised in many ways. Search teams should be briefed to look for unidentified objects or anything that: \n \na) \nshould not be there; \n \nb) \ncannot be accounted for; or \n \nc) \nis out of place. \n \n \n \nSEARCHING AIRCRAFT \n \n8. \nThe large number of aircraft in service throughout the world makes it impossible to provide guidance for \nrecommended aircraft inspection procedures that will be adequate in all cases. \n \n9. \nAircraft operators should develop an aircraft search procedure checklist for each type of aircraft in service \nand include this checklist as part of flight crew security kits. Use of such a checklist is particularly helpful at locations \nwhere the only persons familiar with the particular type or configuration of aircraft are flight crew compartment and cabin \ncrew members. \n \n10. \nAn isolated aircraft parking position may be the best location at an airport in which to search an aircraft \nsubjected to a specific threat, but contingency plans should recognize that it may not always be possible to access this \nlocation. \n \n11. \nAircraft searches should be carried out in good lighting conditions. This may require the use of auxiliary \npower units or the attachment of ground power lines to an aircraft. \n \n12. \nTo avoid duplication of effort, a search of an aircraft should be conducted systematically by staff familiar \nwith the particular aircraft, provided with a checklist and assigned to specific areas of the aircraft. Attention should be \ngiven to those areas to which passengers have had access, such as main cabins, galley areas and toilets, but a search \nshould also include the flight crew compartment exterior and cargo holds. \n \n13. \nIf a suspect explosive device is found either within or in the immediate vicinity of an aircraft, the initial \naction should be to withdraw all personnel to a safe distance and await the arrival of EOD experts. Any further decision \nto move the aircraft away from the device or the device away from the aircraft should take into account the main priority, \nwhich is the preservation of life. Moving the aircraft may involve putting at risk additional personnel, such as ground \nengineers, marshalling staff and aircraft tug drivers, should the suspect device explode, whereas leaving the aircraft in \nsitu and evacuating all personnel to a safe location may result only in damage to the aircraft and terminals or facilities.",

The objective is to ensure that \nthe entire terminal building is checked as quickly and effectively as possible. \n \n15. \nSearch plans should be readily available at all times. Architect drawings, checked for accuracy and \nappropriately adapted, are suitable for this purpose. Sufficient spare copies should be available for use during search \noperations. Searchers and coordinators can then eliminate sections from the plan as they are declared clear. \n \n \nAreas \n \n16. \nThe first step in preparing a search plan is to divide the terminal building into areas. The building may \nalready be segregated into various zones and, therefore, it may be convenient to designate these as the appropriate \nareas. The area should be of manageable size for the number of searchers designated for each, as effective and \nsystematic searching takes time. \n \n17. \nAreas may be one large room, such as a check-in area, concourse or baggage reclaim area, or a number \nof small aircraft operator operations offices in an office suite. Cloakrooms, stairs, corridors and elevators should be \nincluded in search plans, as well as parking areas and other areas outside the building. \n \n \nTeams \n \n18. \nSearch teams should be composed of staff members nominated to search those areas with which they are \nmost familiar. The number of staff members required will depend on the size of the search task. Reserves should be \nappointed in case of absences. Staff should be trained and on-the-job training provided. \n \n \nPriorities \n \n19. \nAreas that will be used as evacuation assembly areas, together with areas where the greatest number of \nthe public or staff members are likely to be vulnerable, should be searched first. Also, as a priority, those public areas to \nwhich perpetrators may have had easy access, should be considered, such as restrooms, elevators, stairways and \nhallways. Areas to which access is normally controlled may be searched last. Parking areas, the outside area of the \nterminal building and the perimeter should not be overlooked. \n \n \n \nCONDUCT OF SEARCH \n \n20. \nThe conduct of searches will depend on local circumstances and local knowledge. The overriding principle \nis that they should be conducted in a systematic and thorough manner so that no area is left unchecked. Searchers \nshould hold practices in order to become accustomed to the logical progression through their designated areas, whether \na terminal building, baggage reclaim area, administrative or operations office suite, etc., and the length of time a search \nwill take.",

Each searcher or team should first stand still and \nlook around the room, noting the contents, and making a quick assessment of those areas that will \nneed special attention. Searchers should look for any unusual lights, including small light sources \nknown as light emitting diodes which are often used in the arming circuits of IEDs. They should also \nlisten carefully for any unusual noises, particularly ticking or whirring sounds. If nothing unusual is \nseen, the search should begin; \n \nb) \nif anything unusual is seen, searchers should alert the coordinator who will decide whether to \nevacuate the building; \n \nc) \nthe search should be conducted methodically, moving in one direction around the area to be \nsearched, and should be carried out in three sweeps, as follows: \n \n1) \nfirst sweep \u2013 work around the edges of the room, taking in the walls from top to bottom and the \nfloor area immediately beneath walls. Look inside fireplaces, behind curtains and window blinds, \nand behind and beside furniture around the edges of the room. The sweep should finish at the \ndoorway where it began; \n \n2) \nsecond sweep \u2013 take in the furniture and the floor. Furniture should not be removed but drawers \nshould be opened and searched and gaps in and under furniture should be explored. If the floor \ncovering shows signs of recent disturbance, it should be lifted; and \n \n3) \nthird sweep \u2013 scan the ceiling, if it is of a kind in which objects might be concealed. Start at one \ncorner and systematically search the whole surface; \n \nd) \nafter the search has been completed, and if nothing has been found, the coordinator should be \nimmediately informed so that the area may be marked clear on search plans; \n \ne) \nsearching should continue until the whole area has been cleared. The possibility of secondary devices \nshould not be discounted; and \n \nf) \nif a suspicious object is found, the following rules should be observed: \n \n1) \ndo not touch or move the object; \n \n2) \nif possible leave a distinctive marker near but not touching the object; \n \n3) \nmove away from the object to a designated control point, leaving lights on; \n \n4) \ninform the search team leader or coordinator. The coordinator should implement the evacuation \nplan; \n \n5) \nstay at the control point and draw an accurate plan of the location of the suspicious object for the \nassistance of police and EOD experts; and",

If there is the slightest doubt, the coordinator should consider one of the other options; \n \nb) \nsearch and then evacuate if a suspicious object is found \u2013 if there is an explosive device, this option \nentails persons remaining in the terminal building for a longer period of time. If the device is found, the \narea may be evacuated. If no object is found and there are no other significant factors, the coordinator \nmay consider this option appropriate if the threat level is assessed as low; \n \nc) \nevacuate all persons except search teams and essential staff, and then carry out a search and \nevacuate fully if a suspicious object is discovered \u2013 if the threat level is assessed as moderate, but \nthere is no reason to believe that an explosion may be imminent, or if the suspect device is small,",
  "912": "App 41-6 \nAviation Security Manual \nSensitive Security Information \nDissemination, reproduction or onward distribution of this document is expressly prohibited without the consent of the originators. \n \n \n \nsuch as a letter bomb, and parts of the terminal building are a considerable distance from the device, \nthe coordinator may consider evacuating part of the terminal building or retaining only essential staff \nand search teams within the terminal building; and \n \nd) \nevacuate all staff immediately then reoccupy with trained searchers \u2013 if a call is received which the \ncoordinator considers indicates the existence of a high level of risk, there will be a case for evacuating \nas quickly as possible without conducting a search, especially if there is a possibility of an imminent \nexplosion. If the time of explosion was disclosed in the telephone threat, the coordinator should ensure \nthat any searches are finished and staff cleared at least 20 minutes before the deadline, irrespective of \nwhether any device is found. \n \n \n \nEVACUATION PLANS \n \n28. \nAs with search plans, coordinators should have up-to-date drawings of evacuation routes, especially if \nthere are a number of exits from a terminal building, in order to: \n \na) \nevacuate as quickly and efficiently as possible using all available exits. A public address system can \nhelp in directing staff to particular exits. If no other form of communication is available, fire alarms may \nbe used, providing they can be sounded in a way that distinguishes from a fire warning, staff have \nbeen trained to recognize the signal, and alarms are not part of an automated system connected to \nthe local fire service. Use of fire alarms is a poor alternative to a public address system and should \nonly be employed temporarily, pending the installation of a more efficient system; and \n \nb) \nprovide alternative routes for evacuation so that persons can leave the terminal building without being \nplaced in danger by passing close to the suspect explosive device. For example, if there are four \nevacuation routes but one of the routes runs closer to the suspect explosive device than the others, \nthe coordinator may decide to evacuate at once using the other routes only. \n \n29. \nTo ensure the safe evacuation of members of the public, the coordinator should consider using staff \nmembers as evacuation marshals, in order to ensure that the public leaves quickly and without panic by the preselected \nroutes. Evacuation marshals should be selected in advance and trained in their roles. \n \n30. \nEvacuation plans should show two designated assembly areas in opposite directions where persons \nshould congregate after evacuation. Fire assembly points may be utilized for this purpose, provided that they are located \nat a minimum 400 m from the terminal building. In some circumstances, assembly areas may need to be up to 1 000 m \naway from the building. EOD expert advice should be sought as to whether this is necessary. \n \n31. \nIdeally, all employees and members of the public should be asked to take any personal belongings and \nbaggage in their possession with them, since this will help to avoid unnecessary suspicion over articles of property left \nbehind after an evacuation. However, this will be difficult to implement unless a public address system or other suitable \nmeans of communication is readily available and used properly. \n \n32. \nPersonnel and passengers who have been evacuated may have to remain outside for a long time before a \nterminal building is declared safe, so it is best if shelter can be provided under cover. It may be possible to seek \naccommodation by arrangement in alternative buildings. This provides the opportunity to shelter from weather, maintain \ngood communication and cater to individual needs.",

Lights should be left on, but plant and machinery shut down where practicable. \nProcedures should be established to ensure concessionaire kitchen facilities are left in a safe condition. Utilities such as \ngas and water not required to facilitate the search of an area in a building should be turned off, unless this affects the \nbuilding firefighting sprinkler system, in order to minimize damage in the event of an explosion. \n \n \n36. \nA method should be devised to check that everyone has left the terminal building after an evacuation and \nthat all personnel, staff and visitors are accounted for. No one should be allowed to re-enter until the building is declared \nsafe. \n \n \nDECISION TO REOCCUPY \n \n37. \nOnce an evacuation has been completed, the coordinator will have to decide when the building may be re- \noccupied. If a suspect explosive device has been found, the decision to reoccupy will require close coordination with \npolice and security services until the device is declared safe. \n \n38. \nThere may be another suspicious object in the terminal building, undiscovered because the search was \nterminated and the terminal building evacuated due to the discovery of the first suspect explosive device. The \ncoordinator should therefore have the rest of the terminal building searched before considering reoccupation. If an \nevacuation was carried out before any search, the coordinator should initiate a search before considering reoccupation. \n \n39. \nIf a time has been given for an explosion, but no explosion occurs, the coordinator should ensure that at \nleast one hour is allowed to lapse after that time before search procedures are initiated or recommenced. \n \n \nSTAFF TRAINING \n \n40. \nProper training should be conducted so that, in the event of a need to search and evacuate, not only the \nsearch teams, but also every airport employee, will know what to do. Regular search and evacuation drills help maintain \nstaff awareness and vigilance. All staff should be made aware of the evacuation assembly points. Telephonists, \ninformation counter staff and any other persons likely to answer a telephone number available to the public should be \ninstructed in how to handle a bomb threat received by telephone. Actions to be taken by recipients of bomb threats can \nbe found in Attachment A to Appendix 38, paragraph 6. \n \n41. \nOther key staff members such as evacuation marshals should know their role and be regularly trained. It is \nimportant that all staff recognize those who have been specially nominated and obey their instructions. Procedures \nshould ensure that nominated staff are replaced when they leave or are temporarily absent, so that there are no lapses \nof coverage.",

Most are produced and used for legitimate industrial, agricultural or medical purposes, \ne.g.   hydrogen   cyanide,   chlorine   (industrial)   and   organophosphates   (agricultural). \n \nBiological Agents \u2013 including bacteria, viruses, other microorganisms and their associated toxins. They \nhave the ability to adversely affect human health in a variety of ways, ranging from relatively mild allergic \nreactions to serious medical conditions, even death. Biological agents can be transmitted through \ninhalation, ingestion, through skin absorption or through direct contact with other persons, body fluids or \ninfected surfaces. Symptoms after exposure can develop within hours in some cases, but most often \ndevelop within a few days. \n \nRadiological Agents \u2013 including radiological materials used in hospitals and industry. A radiological \ndevice or radiological dispersion device is any device that is designed to spread radioactive material \nwith the intent to contaminate persons and surroundings, and can possibly cause cancer, birth defects \nand other medical effects. Radioactive materials can emit different types of radiation depending on the \nisotopes involved. \n \nNote.\u2014 Contamination of persons can cause long-term health effects such as cancers and birth defects. \nPregnant women and children can be especially susceptible. Site contamination can render infrastructure, such as \nbuildings and transport systems, unusable for long periods, possibly years. \n \n \n2. \nGENERAL PRINCIPLES \n \n \nCrisis and response management \n \n2.1 \nThe purpose of CBR crisis and response management is to protect public health, particularly that of the \ntravelling public. It is also to restore essential airport services and provide emergency relief to those affected by a CBR \nincident. This appendix, however, only addresses those aspects of a crisis and response management, and therefore \nonly measures the immediate effects of such CBR incidents. Longer-term recovery issues should be dealt with by using \nexisting disaster recovery plans. \n \n3  This guidance material does not address the specificities inherent in events caused by radiological agents. In this regard, the Joint \nRadiation Emergency Management Plan of the International Organizations published by the International Atomic Agency, and co- \nsponsored by ICAO, should be referred to. \n4  This guidance should be read in conjunction with Chapter 17 on crisis management and response to acts of unlawful interference.",
  "923": "Appendix 44 Chemical, biological and radiological (CBR) incidents \nApp 44-11 \nSensitive Security Information \nDissemination, reproduction or onward distribution of this document is expressly prohibited without the consent of the originators. \n \n \n \n \n2.2 \nA CBR incident is any occurrence resulting from the use of CBR agents and/or the release of toxic \nmaterials into the environment (this can be via a device or directly). States should develop and test an emergency \nresponse plan (also referred to as \u201cCrisis Management Plan\u201d or \u201cContingency Plans\u201d) and strategy aimed at responding \nto and managing the effects of a CBR incident. A CBR response plan demonstrates the overarching capability of a State \nto prepare for, respond to, and recover from the effects of an act of unlawful interference by means of a CBR incident. \nSuch CBR response strategies may exist at the general State level, not specific to aviation, such as State public health \nemergency response plans. Furthermore, CBR response strategies may already exist at the airport level as part of the \nresponse to incidents involving Dangerous Goods. More information on the management of public health emergencies in \naviation can be found in the ICAO Manual of Civil Aviation Medicine (Doc 8984), including information on the ICAO \nCAPSCA (Collaborative Arrangement for the Prevention and Management of Public Health Events in Civil Aviation) \nprogramme. \n \n2.3 \nBecause CBR incidents have the potential to shut down airport operations, an adequate CBR response \nplan should help minimize the consequences of such incidents and give the maximum chance to re-open the airport and \nrestore public confidence in as short a time as possible. Such a plan should be tested and updated on a frequent basis \nwith all involved partners and stakeholders at the airport. All involved personnel at the airport should understand the \nbasic principles of the response plan, and their assigned role, and act accordingly. \n \n2.4 \nCrisis management plans, which include emergency and contingency measures and requirements, should \naddress CBR crisis and response management. Information on such plans can be found in Chapter 17 of this manual. \n \n \nIncidents and their effects \n \n2.5 \nCBR incidents may come in many forms, and the various substances may have different medical effects. \nThe immediacy of their effect, their lethality, persistence and ease of distribution can vary greatly from one form to the \nother. CBR incidents can have a huge impact on airport infrastructure and the aviation industry in general. Releasing a \nchemical or biological agent can easily be conducted without the traveling public noticing anything at an airport and, in \nsome cases, the agent that was used can show its effect a few days or weeks after exposure. \n \n2.6 \nA possible contamination with a CBR agent can make a specific area of an airport (e.g. airport terminal) \nunusable for years without the possibility of conducting operations from that part of the airport. Furthermore, note that \neffects on passengers and staff from an incident using biological or radiological agents, whether immediate or delayed, \ncould result in operational consequences of an initial CBR incident being high with a huge societal impact not only just \nafter the incident (short term) but also in the long term. \n \n2.7 \nThe primary role and responsibility of the airport authority is to act as first responder, notify appropriate \nCBR entities and coordinate with the involved entities to prepare for and respond to CBR events. This guidance focuses \nprimarily on the identification of potential threat of, reaction to and the short-term recovery from a CBR incident. CBR \nsecurity awareness training and/or instructions should be provided to all airport staff as a component of broader aviation \nsecurity awareness training. This includes airport staff that work within the terminal building, such as retailers and check- \nin staff; those who work in airside and landside facilities, such as air traffic control and cargo operators; and frequent \nusers of the airport environment, such as delivery companies. More detailed training and instruction on required actions \nshould also be provided to airport staff identified in the airport\u2019s incident response/contingency plans as having an active \nrole in responding to a CBR event.",

Assessments should take into account up-to-date \ninformation on CBR threats and potential impacts, as well as mitigation measures and residual vulnerabilities. Advice on \nthe conduct of risk assessments and further high-level information on CBR risks can be found in the ICAO Aviation \nSecurity Global Risk Context Statement (Doc 10108 \u2013 Restricted). \n \n3.2 \nOnce a risk assessment has been completed, the results can be used to identify specific local \nvulnerabilities and any potential local mitigations that may be considered to address these and to manage the residual \nrisks as far as possible. \n \n3.3 \nThe risk assessment should also be used to inform response plans. A risk management process should \nplay an integral role in assisting the chief of the crisis management team (CMT) at the CBR emergency operations \ncentre to make decisions on with whom to share risk information and where to apply all the available resources and \nequipment to minimize the effects of the threats and hazards. \n \n \n4. \nPLANNING \n \n4.1 \nCurrent and emerging CBR threats involve the release of chemical, biological and radiological agents or \nthe contamination of either food or water. The health of persons exposed will be affected if such a threat is realized and \nthe signs and symptoms of exposure will become apparent immediately or after a certain period of time (latency period). \nTherefore, resilience against such threats is needed and appropriate countermeasures should be planned and executed. \n \n4.2 \nCBR response plans should aim to minimize the loss of life, number of persons affected by short- and \nlong- term health impacts and damage to property and the environment, and include: \n \na) \nan operational framework that allows for rapid response and the implementation of authorized \nmeasures with the goal of minimizing the loss of life and property; and \n \nb) \nappropriate measures to assist with the response and any required short-term recovery (that includes \nthe establishment of adequate plans, policies, procedures, training and equipment necessary to \neffectively respond to CBR incidents). \n \nNote.\u2014 Information on the preparation of airport emergency plans is contained in Part 7 of the Airport \nServices Manual (Doc 9137). \n \nCollaboration \n \n4.3 \nAirport authorities should establish an understanding of the capabilities that exist among the first response \ncommunity inside and outside of the airport for CBR planning and response purposes (e.g. local fire services and \nparamedics), including by carrying out table-top exercises and drills. In addition, considerations should be given to the \nrole of the private sector (e.g. radiological industries) to assist in a radiological event. \n \n4.4 \nCBR response considers and includes all available capabilities of civil authorities concerned, from local \nfirst responders, up to state level response. In the case that civil authorities lack the required and necessary CBR \nmitigation capabilities to effectively respond to a CBR incident, appropriate military support should be considered to \neffectively handle the situation.",

National planning scenarios should therefore \ninclude all potentially involved stakeholders, such as all airport operators, law enforcement agencies, aircraft operators, \npublic health authorities and other parties concerned. \n \n4.6 \nIn order to effectively counter a possible CBR threat, relevant strategies to mitigate the risks and respond \nto events should be formulated, respective plans should be developed, and appropriate information-sharing at the State \nlevel and with stakeholders should take place. In the case of response management relating to an act of unlawful \ninterference by means of a CBR attack, the risk assessment process can only be effective if appropriate information is \nmade available in a timely manner. \n \n \n5. \nCOORDINATION \n \n5.1 \nWhen developing/updating CBR response strategies for aviation, existing CBR response plans should be \nconsidered, such as: \n \na) \nnational plans for CBR incidents that are holistic and not specific to aviation; \n \nb) \naviation safety response plans dealing with CBR hazards within the carriage of dangerous goods; \n \nc) \npandemic response plans within the context of aviation facilitation; and \n \nd) \nother relevant contingency and emergency plans (e.g. public health emergency response plans). \n \nNote.\u2014 Information on the preparation of airport emergency plans is contained in Part 7 of the Airport \nServices Manual (Doc 9137). \n \n \n6. \nINITIAL AIRPORT AND AVIATION FACILITY DESIGN \n \n6.1 \nResponse to CBR incidents and mitigation of their effects should be considered in airport design. Such \nconsiderations may include: \n \na) \nlocating mailrooms/loading docks at the perimeter of the terminal or at a remote location with \nscreening devices or other types of equipment in place that can detect explosives and/or identify \nchemical/biological contaminants. If such a location cannot be accommodated, the installation of a \ndedicated ventilation system, that can be shut off in case of emergency, should be considered; \n \nb) \nestablishing measures to seal off contaminated areas from the rest of the terminal to minimize the \npotential for contaminants to migrate to other areas of the terminal. A slight negative pressure should \nbe maintained in these rooms to help prevent the spread of the contaminants to other areas; \n \nc) \nensuring that air intakes to ventilation systems are not accessible to the public. Preferably, air intakes \nshould be located as high as practicable on a wall or on the roof. If vents are located at ground level, \nthey should be protected as much as possible with screens or grates, and have their openings facing \naway from public exposure;",

Of particular \nconcern are attacks against airport facilities and installations involving the use of, or the threat of using CBR devices or \nagents. \n \n7.2 \nActs of unlawful interference through intentional release of CBR agents or substances include the \ndeliberate use of CBR agents with the intention to cause injury and death and/or to generate general fear and panic \nwithin an airport environment and the general vicinity. Examples are: \n \na) \ndispersal of CBR agents as gases, liquids, aerosols or solids within the departure hall of an airport \nusing munitions, explosives or other means of dispersal (e.g. spray devices) which would lead to the \ncontamination over wide areas of the departure hall or within special target zones like check-in desks \nand/or security checkpoints; \n \nb) \nuse of CBR agents for small or large-scale contamination of food and/or water supplies at an airport; \n \nc) \ntargeted delivery of CBR agents to individuals or groups (e.g. by post to the airport authority or aircraft \noperator offices) leading to contamination of individuals and buildings (e.g. anthrax spores); and \n \nd) \nuse of the ventilation system to deliver chemical gases such as chlorines or other easily available \nchemicals. \n \n \n \n8. \nIMPACTS OF CBR INCIDENTS TO AIRPORT INFRASTRUCTURE AND OPERATIONS \n \n8.1 \nA CBR incident can have very serious impacts on an airport, including disruption of operations and \nconsequential cancellation of flights and services. The public health and emergency services on-scene will likely be \naffected by the CBR incident, either directly as they are stationed at the airport, or indirectly through the emergency \nresponse. The transportation and communication infrastructure may be stressed through evacuation, providing relief \nsupplies, or as a direct result of the CBR incident. \n \n8.2 \nAnother consequence of CBR incidents is the contamination of infrastructure and terrain at airports. The \nactual contamination can be concentrated or spread over a significant area depending on the means of delivery and the \nagent used. The airside areas of an airport are of operational concern during the recovery phase of the incident. For \nlarger areas of contamination, special support groups might be needed in order to assist with the decontamination efforts \nand infrastructure restoration.",

The reaction time to a CBR incident has a considerable effect on the consequences of such an \nincident. The first hour following a CBR incident is often deemed critical, regardless of potential latency periods. \nTherefore, in the event of a suspected CBR incident at an airport, all airport staff and flight crews need to act as quickly \nas possible and without knowing the exact nature of the threat or the device. Appropriate communication means and \nmechanisms should be established to ensure that all airport staff can be informed in the event of a suspected CBR \nincident. \n \n9.2 \nOn activation of the CBR response, clear and contaminated areas should be clearly demarcated. All \npersons should be decontaminated before being allowed to proceed to a clear area. Stocks of coveralls, bags for \ncontaminated clothes, plastic sheeting for radiological incidents, barriers for crowd control, and selected medicine and \ndrugs should be deployed as quickly as possible. \n \n9.3 \nThe composition of each CBR response team should be based on incident type and severity. Recognizing \nthat responsibilities for different elements of the response will vary from State to State, the following should be \nconsidered: \n \na) \nEmergency Operations Centre (EOC) \n \nThe airport incident commander would normally manage a CBR incident and ensure coordination with, \nand provide up to date information to, all involved parties (including all response teams), and provide \nsituational awareness to all State agencies and stakeholders involved. When the incident commander \nat the scene requires additional support due to the size and scope of the incident, the EOC should \ntake responsibility for managing the CBR incident as well as the exchange of information between all \ninvolved agencies and stakeholders. A Chief of the CMT, in charge of the EOC, should be appointed. \n \nb) \nFirst Response Team \n \nThis qualified and specially trained team (e.g. airport rescue and fire services, emergency services \nand police) should be able to locate, detect and identify potential hazards and threats. \n \nc) \nCBR Response Team \n \nThe members of this team should provide protection to all involved personnel responding to a CBR \nincident. This should include collecting samples, monitoring and marking the contaminated areas and \nreporting back to the EOC. They may be deployed for additional security tasks e.g. providing convoy \nand patient transport security and establishing an access control regime. \n \nd) \nCBR Medical Assistance Team \n \nThis team should be formed of suitably trained medical staff to undertake triage, treatment, initial \ntracking and transport of contaminated persons. \n \ne) \nCBR Decontamination Team \n \nThis team should support methods and technologies required to neutralize or remove hazardous \nmaterials, including chemical and biological warfare agents and radiological contamination.",

Such coordination should include representatives of the lead agency, supporting agencies \nand the State and regional authorities according to predefined communication and information protocols. The objectives \nof these protocols are to provide clear and consistent communication, promote effective interagency information flow, \nand provide public reassurance around the response to and resolution of the incident. \n \n12.2 \nConsiderations should be given to public messaging through intercoms, flight information boards and/or \nany other available relevant methods (e.g. social media platforms), in accordance with appropriate emergency response \nplans.

Clearly, it is in the interest of all to familiarize crew members with information and provide an awareness \nof the threat posed by their potential presence on board the aircraft along with some means for responding to this in- \nflight emergency. \n \n1.2 \nIf prohibited dangerous goods are carried in the cabin without mal-intent and subsequently released \ncausing an incident, the passenger may not be able (or willing) to effectively communicate what the substance is due to \na lack of knowledge, language barriers or fear of prosecution. Because it may not always be evident that a \nchemical/biological incident is underway, the crew should respond in accordance with ICAO Emergency Response \nGuidance for Aircraft Incidents Involving Dangerous Goods (Doc 9481). It should also be noted that even with the help of \nexperts it might be difficult to distinguish between biological and chemical agents. \n \n1.3 \nChemical or biological (CB) agents/substances may be released by a variety of methods depending on the \nagent concerned. These could include the release of liquid, wet or dry aerosol dispersion or the creation of toxic gases \nthrough a chemical reaction. This type of reaction can be produced by mixing two substances together. The action of \nreleasing the substance into the cabin interior will enable the agent to disperse into the air. Inhalation will likely be the \nprimary means of exposure, but transmission via skin contact or ingestion should not be ruled out. \n \n1.4 \nThe goal is to contain the device\u2019s (or substance\u2019s) dispersal potential before it spreads through the cabin \natmosphere or, if unable, to minimize its effect on passengers and crew as far as possible. \n \n1.5 \nChemical/biological agents, because of their very nature, must be dealt with in a separate, unique manner \nthat is different from explosives. A critical distinction to be made is the difference between the handling of an Improvised \nExplosive Device (IED) and a chemical/biological substance. In many situations, in accordance with the Least Risk \nBomb Location (LRBL) procedures, it may be appropriate to move an IED to the LRBL. However, moving a suspected \nCB substance or device may be inappropriate in some cases. Dealing with a reported CB threat requires a studied plan, \ngood crew resource management, and full participation of both flight crew and cabin crew. Determining the location of \nthe suspected device or CB agent, identifying it and choosing an appropriate reaction to the threat requires calm thinking, \nclear communication and a considered, timely response. \n \n1.6 \nAll crew members should be involved, but it is important to separate responsibilities between the flight crew \ncompartment and cabin. The flight crew should focus on flying the aircraft, managing the cabin temperature, \npressurization and other systems while coordinating with dispatch and assisting agencies. The cabin crew, on the other \nhand, should prepare for and deal with any suspected CB device located within the cabin while executing appropriate \nemergency pre-landing activities. Crew response to CB substances should be tailored to the device\u2019s location (cabin \nversus cargo area) and any manifestation of contamination and possible effects. \n \n \n1. \nThis guidance should be read in conjunction with Chapter 17 on crisis management and response to acts of unlawful \ninterference.",

It should be noted that exposure to biological \nagents will likely not result in an immediate presence of symptoms (it might take hours or days depending on the agent) \nas opposed to similar exposure to chemical agents (for which onsets of symptoms can be rapid); nor will the dispersal of \na biological or chemical agent necessarily be immediately detectable. Some CB agents/substances are odourless and \nwill not be sensed until it is too late. \n \n1.8 \nImmediately reducing cabin temperature will reduce the conversion of liquid hazards to vapour hazards. \nImmediately turning off recirculation fans may reduce the spread of airborne hazards through mechanical ventilation. \nManufacturers-approved checklists, as found in the Operations Manual, should be referred to in that regard. \n \n1.9 \nEven if there appears to be no manifestation of possible CB contamination, passengers and crew should \nremain together and quarantined until checked by trained personnel. \n \n1.10 \nUnexpected exposure to a chemical/biological device within the confines of an aircraft cabin will require a \nswift response. Generally, many biological agents will generate symptoms less rapidly than chemical agents, many of \nwhich can cause immediate symptoms. If time permits due to distance from the nearest suitable airport, advice should \nbe taken from knowledgeable specialists on the differences between biological and chemical agents with regard to \ndispersion and the speed with which they will generate symptoms. \n \n1.11 \nAirborne exposure to toxic agents may result in sudden presentation of symptoms among passengers, \nprobably initially clustered near the point of release. Depending on the agent, passengers and cabin crew may exhibit \nchoking, discolouration and fainting, blistering or convulsions that are beyond the means of crew members to effectively \ndeal with while airborne. Other symptoms could include breathing problems, coughing, nausea, vomiting and even fever \nin some cases (e.g. ricin poisoning). It is important to remember that the symptoms manifested and their speed of onset \nwill depend on the agent, and how it is released, and that the chemical itself may be deceptively odourless or of a mild \nscent. \n \n1.12 \nWhen this situation is reported to the flight crew, immediate actions must be taken (if available, refer to \nQuick Reference Handbook). \n \n1.13 \nAn emergency descent may also be considered. However this action should be balanced against the \ninherent risks of passenger injury associated with rapid descent. Depending on the aircraft and time, maintaining \npressure-differential between passenger cabin and cargo hold can protect from contamination for an incident in the \ncargo compartment. \n \n \nDiverting and deplaning \n \n1.14 \nIf time permits, flight crew should coordinate with air traffic control and the airline\u2019s dispatch or Systems \nOperational Control to land at a suitable alternate airfield equipped with explosive, CB and medical expertise waiting to \nassist with deplaning and, if necessary, decontamination (and quarantine if necessary). The flight crew should also make \nuse of the NOTOC and advise ATC of any dangerous goods on board the aircraft (as a CB threat can originate from a \ncargo compartment). \n \n1.15 \nCoordinating actions with local emergency response agencies is critical. In addition to exposing those on \nboard to a potentially deadly threat, the CB agent also poses a risk to those outside the aircraft, including ground \nhandling crews.",

All passengers and crew should be kept together and quarantined from non-emergency personnel. Even if there \nappears to be no manifestation of possible CB contamination, passengers and crew should remain together and \nquarantined until checked by trained personnel. \n \n1.18 \nPerhaps the most important single factor in assuring a successful outcome to a CB incident is for each \ncrew member to consider in advance how he or she would deal with a genuine CB threat in the airplane. This should be \nreflected in crew training.
